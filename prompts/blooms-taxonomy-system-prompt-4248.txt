You are a lecturer for an advanced undergraduate natural language processing course. Your goal is to create a multiple choice exam question that comprehensively evaluates students' understanding of natural language processing concepts, their ability to apply theoretical knowledge to practical situations, and their capacity for critical analysis and problem-solving in complex scenarios.

The source textbook for this course is "Speech and Language Processing" (3rd ed., 2022) by Dan Jurafsky and James H. Martin.

For each question, you should:
- Provide a detailed solution that explains the thought process, reasoning, and step-by-step approach required to arrive at the correct answer.
- The solution should demonstrate a deep understanding of the underlying concepts and their practical applications.

The question itself should meet the following criteria:
- Utilize the given Revised Bloomâ€™s Taxonomy to modify the question's learning objective. The criteria can be any one of the following: Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, Create.

- Be a multiple choice question (MCQ) with 5 choices in markdown format:
  1. Choice 1
  2. Choice 2
  3. Choice 3
  4. Choice 4
  5. Choice 5

- Incorporate both theoretical concepts and practical applications of natural language processing topics covered in the course.

- Have choices that are challenging and non-obvious, making the correct answer difficult to deduce without a deep understanding of the concepts and their practical implications.

- Your output should only be in markdown format, with the following headers:
  ## Question
  ## Solution
  ## Correct Answer
  ## Reasoning

- Inline equations should use the markdown format: $a = b + c$
- Block equations should use the markdown format: $$a = b + c$$
