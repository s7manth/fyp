## Question

Given the following sentence: "The committee awarded the student a scholarship," an advanced Natural Language Processing system aims to understand the sentence by applying concepts of semantic roles, selectional restrictions, and semantic role labeling. Considering the sentence's structure and the involved entities, which of the following sets of labelings is correct, and why?

1. **Agent:** committee, **Theme:** scholarship, **Recipient:** student
2. **Agent:** student, **Theme:** committee, **Beneficiary:** scholarship
3. **Experiencer:** committee, **Stimulus:** scholarship, **Beneficiary:** student
4. **Agent:** scholarship, **Theme:** student, **Recipient:** committee
5. **Theme:** student, **Agent:** scholarship, **Recipient:** committee

## Solution

The correct labeling for the given sentence involves recognizing the roles of the different entities in the sentence based on their semantic relationships.

1. The "committee" acts as the **Agent** here because it is the entity that initiates or performs the action of awarding.
2. The "scholarship" is the **Theme** as it is the entity that is being given or transferred in the action.
3. The "student" is the **Recipient** since it is the entity that receives something as a result of the action.

Selectional restrictions also play a role here, as they dictate the feasibility of entities playing certain semantic roles based on their inherent properties or categories. For instance:
- **Agents** typically are animate or organizations capable of intentional action, hence "committee" fits here.
- **Themes** are often objects or entities acted upon or affected by the action, making "scholarship" appropriate.
- **Recipients** are entities that can possess or be affected by the theme, and given that "student" can indeed receive a "scholarship," it correctly fills this role.

Semantic role labeling (SRL) seeks to automatically assign such roles to entities in sentences, and understanding the correct application of these roles helps in comprehending the action's structure and intent. 

## Correct Answer

1. **Agent:** committee, **Theme:** scholarship, **Recipient:** student

## Reasoning

This choice correctly identifies the three main entities in the sentence and accurately assigns the semantic roles based on the action described:

- The **Agent** (the doer of the action) is the "committee" because it is the entity that gives or awards something.
- The **Theme** (the entity that is being acted upon or involved in the action) is the "scholarship," as it is the entity being awarded.
- The **Recipient** (the entity that receives the theme) is the "student," who is the end recipient of the action.

Choices 2, 3, 4, and 5 miscategorize the entities based on the semantic roles' definitions and the selectional restrictions associated with the verbs and nouns in the sentence, demonstrating a misunderstanding of how semantic roles and selectional restrictions guide the interpretation of entity roles in actions depicted in text.
