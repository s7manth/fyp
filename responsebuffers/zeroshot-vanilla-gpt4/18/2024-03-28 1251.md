## Question
Given a complex sentence from a novel, "The storm unleashed its fury, and the ancient tree was torn from the earth, roots and all, landing with a thunderous crash on the old, deserted cabin." An NLP system is tasked with semantic role labeling (SRL) to analyze the actions described in this sentence. Considering the advanced concepts of semantic roles, selectional restrictions, and diathesis alternations, which of the following outcomes most accurately reflects the challenges and potential solutions an NLP system might encounter in processing this sentence?

1. The system accurately identifies "the storm" as the agent and "the ancient tree" as the theme in both actions, but struggles to associate "the old, deserted cabin" as the final location due to the complex sentence structure.
2. The system easily parses the sentence, applies primitive decomposition of predicates, but fails to recognize "unleashed its fury" and "torn from the earth, roots and all" due to the metaphorical language that does not directly map to clear physical actions.
3. The system identifies "the storm" as the cause of the actions, but mislabels "the ancient tree" as an agent in the second clause, incorrectly applying the selectional restriction rules that expect animate agents.
4. The system correctly identifies all semantic roles and applies diathesis alternation rules to account for the passive construction of "was torn," but struggles with frame selection for "landing with a thunderous crash," failing to link it to the causative action.
5. The system perfectly labels all actions and roles, including correctly handling the metaphoric expression "unleashed its fury," by utilizing a comprehensive FrameNet database that includes frames for natural phenomena acting as agents.

## Solution
To correctly answer this question, students need to understand the complexities of semantic role labeling (SRL), particularly when dealing with metaphorical language, passive constructions, and the identification of agents and themes in complex sentences. The sentence provided poses challenges in these areas, requiring the application of several advanced NLP concepts:

- **Semantic Roles and Diathesis Alternations:** Identifying agents, themes, and other roles within passive constructions ("was torn") and assessing how the roles shift in such sentences.
- **Selectional Restrictions:** Understanding that certain verbs and actions imply restrictions on their subjects and objects (e.g., "unleashed its fury" implying a non-human agent).
- **Primitive Decomposition of Predicates and Frame Selection:** Decomposing complex actions into more basic elements that can be more easily processed and matching them to appropriate frames in systems like FrameNet, which could struggle with metaphorical expressions or unusual constructions.

Given these considerations, the most accurate outcome reflecting the challenges an NLP system might face and how it could address them is:

**Option 4:** The system correctly identifies all semantic roles and applies diathesis alternation rules to account for the passive construction of "was torn," but struggles with frame selection for "landing with a thunderous crash," failing to link it to the causative action.

This option highlights several key points:
- The understanding and correct application of semantic role labeling to both clear and complex parts of the sentence.
- The recognition of diathesis alternations in handling passive constructions effectively.
- The challenge of frame selection in FrameNet for metaphorical or less common expressions, a real issue when dealing with novel or creative language found in literature.

## Correct Answer
4. The system correctly identifies all semantic roles and applies diathesis alternation rules to account for the passive construction of "was torn," but struggles with frame selection for "landing with a thunderous crash," failing to link it to the causative action.

## Reasoning
This choice best encapsulates the multifaceted challenges involved in processing complex sentences with advanced NLP techniques. It recognizes the success of semantic role labeling and the correct application of diathesis alternations to interpret passive constructions accurately. However, it also acknowledges the inherent difficulty in applying FrameNet to unusual or metaphorical language, reflecting a deep understanding of both the capabilities and limitations of current NLP systems. This scenario requires students to synthesize concepts from semantic roles, diathesis alternations, and FrameNet application, demonstrating a comprehensive grasp of advanced NLP topics.
