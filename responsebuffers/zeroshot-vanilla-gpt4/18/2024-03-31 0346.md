## Question
Suppose you are working on a natural language processing project focused on understanding complex narrative texts. As part of your project, you decide to enhance the system's ability to infer relationships and actions described in the text, incorporating advanced semantic role labeling (SRL) techniques. You aim to achieve this by integrating and adapting features from FrameNet, PropBank, and an understanding of selectional restrictions and diathesis alternations. Given a sentence from a narrative, "The council awarded the artist with the grand prize", which approach would most effectively allow your NLP system to understand the roles and actions involved, including implied actions and roles not explicitly mentioned?

1. Solely leverage FrameNet to identify and label the frames and roles involved in the sentence, ignoring diathesis alternations and selectional restrictions.
2. Use PropBank annotations to identify the verb arguments and adjuncts, apply primitive decomposition to infer implicit actions, and ignore selectional restrictions.
3. Employ a combination of FrameNet for capturing the semantic frames, PropBank for detailed verb argument structures, and incorporate selectional restrictions to guide the inference of implied roles and actions.
4. Focus on identifying diathesis alternations present in the sentence to infer all possible syntactic variations, relying on this information alone to understand the implied roles and actions.
5. Implement a system that exclusively depends on semantic role labeling algorithms trained on large corpora, without integrating any specific linguistic theories or frameworks such as FrameNet, PropBank, or understanding of selectional restrictions.

## Solution
To comprehensively understand the roles and actions in the sentence "The council awarded the artist with the grand prize", an NLP system needs to leverage a sophisticated approach that combines detailed semantic frameworks and linguistic theories. Here's why the third option is the most effective:

- **FrameNet** offers a rich lexicon of semantic frames that can help identify the scenarios, entities, and actions described in the text. The sentence in question might evoke a "Giving" frame which includes roles like Giver (the council), Recipient (the artist), and Thing given (the grand prize). However, FrameNet alone might not provide enough granularity for verb argument structures or infer actions and roles that are not explicitly mentioned.

- **PropBank** provides annotations for verbs in terms of their rolesets, offering detailed insights into the arguments associated with specific verb senses. This can complement FrameNet by providing detailed structures for the verb "awarded", identifying the agent, recipient, and the prize as key arguments. Though PropBank adds depth to verb understanding, it doesnâ€™t fully address implied actions or roles nor selectional restrictions.

- **Selectional restrictions** are constraints that certain verbs impose on the possible types of their arguments (e.g., "eat" typically requires an animate subject and edible object). Integrating selectional restrictions helps infer whether the implied roles or actions fit logically within the context, enhancing the system's ability to deduce relationships that aren't explicitly mentioned.

- **Diathesis alternations** involve the different ways a verb can be framed or constructed without changing its essential meaning (e.g., passive vs. active voice). While understanding these alternations can enrich the system's syntactic flexibility, on their own, they don't provide a complete solution for inferring implicit content or understanding the full semantic scope of the narrative.

Therefore, option 3, which suggests employing FrameNet and PropBank together while incorporating selectional restrictions, offers a balanced and comprehensive approach. It combines the strengths of semantic frames and detailed verb argument structure with the logical constraints offered by selectional restrictions, enabling a deeper understanding of both explicit and implicit information in the text.

## Correct Answer
3. Employ a combination of FrameNet for capturing the semantic frames, PropBank for detailed verb argument structures, and incorporate selectional restrictions to guide the inference of implied roles and actions.

## Reasoning
The reasoning behind choosing option 3 as the correct answer lies in its comprehensive approach to understanding not just the explicit content of the sentence, but also the implied roles and actions. **FrameNet** provides a high-level semantic understanding through frames. **PropBank** complements this with its detailed perspective on verb arguments and roles, offering a fine-grained analysis of actions. Lastly, **selectional restrictions** serve as a critical tool for inferring logical implications and relationships, ensuring that the system's interpretations adhere to realistic and linguistically grounded constraints. This combination effectively utilizes the strengths of different semantic and linguistic resources for a more nuanced and complete analysis of narrative texts, thereby surpassing the capabilities of any singular approach outlined in the other options.
