## Question
Given a complex sentence extracted from a large corpus of financial news articles, an NLP system aims to perform Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) to enhance the extraction of meaningful financial events and their participants. The sentence in question is: "The central bank raised interest rates to curb inflation, affecting global markets." When applying SRL, the system identifies "raised" and "affecting" as the main predicates. Considering the semantic roles and the practical applications of SRL in financial texts, which of the following best describes the roles assigned to "interest rates" and "global markets" and the underlying challenges the system might face in this scenario?

1. "Interest rates" is labeled as Agent for "raised" and "global markets" is labeled as Theme for "affecting", with the challenge being the identification of implicit agents.
2. "Interest rates" is labeled as Theme for "raised" and "global markets" is labeled as Experiencer for "affecting", with the challenge being distinguishing between literal and metaphorical uses of verbs.
3. "Interest rates" is labeled as Theme for "raised" and "global markets" is labeled as Theme for "affecting", with the challenge being the identification of causal relationships between predicates.
4. "Interest rates" is labeled as Instrument for "raised" and "global markets" is labeled as Goal for "affecting", with the challenge being the polysemy of financial terminology.
5. "Interest rates" is labeled as Beneficiary for "raised" and "global markets" is labeled as Source for "affecting", with the challenge being the correct interpretation of financial jargon in the context of global events.

## Solution
The correct labeling, considering the context of the sentence, would be:

- "Interest rates" should be labeled as the Theme for "raised" because it is the entity that is being acted upon by the action of raising. The central bank is performing the action (raising), making it the Agent, and "interest rates" are what is being affected by this action.
- "Global markets" should be labeled as Theme for "affecting" since they are being impacted by the inflation-curbing action, making them the entity undergoing the effect of the predicate "affecting".

Therefore, the labels for "interest rates" and "global markets" are Theme for both verbs, respectively.

The underlying challenge in this scenario involves the identification of causal relationships between predicates ("raised" leading to "curb inflation" which then affects "global markets"). This complexity arises because the system must not only label semantic roles within each verb phrase but also understand the implied causality and effects that one event has on another within the text. This is crucial in financial texts where the implications and outcomes of actions (like raising interest rates) are often the focus of analysis.

## Correct Answer
3. "Interest rates" is labeled as Theme for "raised" and "global markets" is labeled as Theme for "affecting", with the challenge being the identification of causal relationships between predicates.

## Reasoning
This answer is correct because it accurately identifies the semantic roles of "interest rates" and "global markets" within the sentence according to the definitions of semantic roles. The Theme is the entity that experiences or is affected by the action of the verb. In the given sentence, "interest rates" are being raised (hence, Theme of "raised"), and "global markets" are being affected (hence, Theme of "affecting").

The challenge identified in this option—understanding the causal relationships between predicates—is particularly relevant to financial news analysis. The NLP system needs to infer that raising interest rates is an action taken to curb inflation and that this action has further implications, affecting global markets. This inference requires not only parsing the sentence and labeling roles but also understanding the sequence and impact of events described, which goes beyond basic SRL to include aspects of event extraction and causal reasoning, making it the most comprehensive and accurate option among those provided.
