## Question
Given a sentence "The chef cooked the meal," a natural language processing (NLP) system is tasked with semantic role labeling (SRL). The system identifies the following roles: Agent (the chef), Action (cooked), and Theme (the meal). Which of the following enhancements would most improve the system's ability to handle sentences involving diathesis alternations, such as the passive voice "The meal was cooked by the chef"?

1. Incorporating a syntactic parsing step that identifies passive and active voice constructions before applying SRL.
2. Increasing the size of the training dataset with more examples of sentences in active voice.
3. Implementing a rule-based system that swaps the roles of Agent and Theme exclusively for sentences identified as passive.
4. Adding a component to the SRL system that applies primitive decomposition of predicates to abstract out core semantic functions from syntactic variations.
5. Training the system on a larger corpus of annotated texts from FrameNet to enhance its understanding of different frames associated with cooking verbs.

## Solution

The correct solution involves recognizing the challenge posed by diathesis alternations (such as passive and active voice changes) to semantic role labeling tasks. The key is to enhance the NLP system in a way that allows it to understand and accurately label the semantic roles regardless of the syntactic construction of the sentence.

1. **Incorporating a syntactic parsing step** helps identify the grammatical construction of the sentence, which is crucial for accurately assigning semantic roles in both active and passive sentences. However, this alone does not address the deeper issue of understanding the underlying semantics that remain consistent across diathesis alternations.
    
2. **Increasing the size of the training dataset** with more examples of active voice may improve overall performance but doesn't directly solve the problem of understanding and correctly labeling roles in passive voice sentences.
    
3. **Implementing a rule-based system** that simply swaps roles based on passive construction might work in straightforward cases but fails to capture the nuances of semantics in more complex sentences. It also does not generalize well across different verbs and contexts that might not follow a simple active/passive dichotomy.
    
4. **Adding a component for primitive decomposition of predicates** addresses the core issue by abstracting away from syntactic variations to understand the predicate's basic semantic functions. This approach allows the system to recognize the underlying semantic roles (e.g., Agent, Theme) beyond their syntactic realization, thus effectively handling sentences with diathesis alternations.
    
5. **Training on a larger corpus from FrameNet** might enhance the system's overall semantic understanding and its familiarity with different frames. However, this approach does not specifically target the challenge posed by diathesis alternations and may not directly improve the system's ability to correctly identify semantic roles in alternated constructions.

## Correct Answer

4. Adding a component to the SRL system that applies primitive decomposition of predicates to abstract out core semantic functions from syntactic variations.

## Reasoning

The correct answer directly addresses the problem of diathesis alternations affecting the accurate labeling of semantic roles by focusing on the underlying semantic functions rather than the syntactic expression of the sentence. Primitive decomposition of predicates allows the system to understand the essential actions or states described by the verb (e.g., cooking, being cooked), independent of the grammatical construction (active vs. passive voice). This enables the system to consistently identify the roles of the entities involved (Agent, Theme) regardless of the sentence's syntactic form. This approach is superior to simply swapping roles or increasing training data in active voice because it targets the semantic consistency across diathesis alternations, ensuring that the system is robust and accurate in a wide variety of linguistic contexts.
