## Question
The development of large-scale annotated resources such as the Proposition Bank (PropBank) and FrameNet have been significant in advancing the field of natural language processing (NLP), particularly in tasks like semantic role labeling (SRL). Given a sentence "The committee awarded the researcher a grant", an NLP system aims to annotate it with semantic roles. Considering the capabilities of PropBank and FrameNet, along with the concepts of diathesis alternations and selectional restrictions, which of the following statements most accurately reflects the challenges and strategies involved in annotating this sentence?

1. PropBank, relying on a fixed set of verb-specific rolesets, would readily annotate this sentence without any ambiguity because of its clear verb-centered structure.
2. FrameNet, with its emphasis on encapsulating semantic frames, would face difficulty assigning roles due to its lack of verb-specific frames for situations involving award ceremonies.
3. Considering diathesis alternation, transforming the active voice of the sentence into a passive form ("The researcher was awarded a grant by the committee") simplifies the annotation process by reducing the number of arguments to be labeled.
4. Selectional restrictions play a critical role in this annotation task by eliminating improbable verb-argument combinations, ensuring that "award" is not mistakenly associated with roles relevant to physical actions like "hit" or "run".
5. Primitive decomposition would significantly complicate the annotation process as it would necessitate breaking down "awarded" into more basic predicates, hence confusing the original semantic roles associated with the verb.

## Solution
The correct answer is **4. Selectional restrictions play a critical role in this annotation task by eliminating improbable verb-argument combinations, ensuring that "award" is not mistakenly associated with roles relevant to physical actions like "hit" or "run".**

### Reasoning
1. **Choice 1** suggests that PropBank assigns roles without ambiguity due to the clear verb-centered structure. However, PropBank annotates roles based on verb-specific rolesets, which can sometimes be ambiguous due to polysemy or when a verb participates in multiple frames or senses.

2. **Choice 2** regards FrameNet facing difficulty with situations not having specific frames. FrameNet is designed to capture a wide variety of scenarios within its frame-based approach, including abstract and complex events like awarding. While it's true that FrameNet focuses less on verb-specific annotations, it is unlikely to face difficulty due to a lack of frames for award situations.

3. **Choice 3** suggests that transforming a sentence into passive voice simplifies the annotation process. While passive transformation, a type of diathesis alternation, changes the surface structure and may affect the prominence of participants, it doesn't necessarily simplify the process. The complication or simplification would depend more on the annotation scheme (verb-specific roles in PropBank vs. frame elements in FrameNet) rather than the voice of the sentence.

4. **Choice 4** accurately reflects the role of selectional restrictions in semantic role labeling and annotation tasks. Selectional restrictions help to ensure that semantic role assignments are plausible given the common meanings and usages of verbs and their typical arguments. In this context, understanding that "award" implies a context of recognizing achievement rather than involving physical action helps distinguish the semantic roles more clearly and avoids annotating the sentence with irrelevant roles.

5. **Choice 5** discusses primitive decomposition complicating the annotation process. Primitive decomposition, breaking down predicates into more fundamental components, is more theoretical and less directly related to the task of annotating specific sentences for semantic roles. While it is an interesting concept in semantic theory, it doesn't have a direct, practical implication on the process or challenge of annotating the given sentence with either PropBank or FrameNet. 

Therefore, while all choices discuss relevant concepts in semantic analysis and annotation, the most directly applicable and accurate reflection of the challenges and strategies is the importance of using selectional restrictions to guide and improve the accuracy of semantic role labeling.

## Correct Answer
4. Selectional restrictions play a critical role in this annotation task by eliminating improbable verb-argument combinations, ensuring that "award" is not mistakenly associated with roles relevant to physical actions like "hit" or "run".
