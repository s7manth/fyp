## Question
Consider the following sentence for semantic role labeling task: "The committee awarded the prize to the renowned scientist for her groundbreaking research on climate change."

Semantic role labeling (SRL) aims to understand the predicate-argument structures of sentences, essentially who did what to whom, when, where, etc. Different frameworks like FrameNet and PropBank have been developed to provide a structured representation of the role information in text. When analyzing this sentence using PropBank conventions, which of the following best describes the semantic roles assigned to the phrases in the sentence?

1. *The committee* - Arg0 (Agent), *awarded* - Verb, *the prize* - Arg1 (Theme), *to the renowned scientist* - Arg2 (Beneficiary), *for her groundbreaking research on climate change* - ArgM-LOC (Locative)
2. *The committee* - Arg1 (Agent), *awarded* - Verb, *the prize* - Arg0 (Theme), *to the renowned scientist* - Arg2 (Beneficiary), *for her groundbreaking research on climate change* - ArgM-PRP (Purpose)
3. *The committee* - Arg0 (Agent), *awarded* - Verb, *the prize* - Arg1 (Theme), *to the renowned scientist* - Arg2 (Recipient), *for her groundbreaking research on climate change* - ArgM-MNR (Manner)
4. *The committee* - Arg0 (Agent), *awarded* - Verb, *the prize* - Arg1 (Theme), *to the renowned scientist* - Arg2 (Recipient), *for her groundbreaking research on climate change* - ArgM-PRP (Purpose)
5. *The committee* - ArgM-CAU (Cause), *awarded* - Verb, *the prize* - Arg0 (Agent), *to the renowned scientist* - Arg1 (Theme), *for her groundbreaking research on climate change* - ArgM-PRP (Purpose)

## Solution
To accurately assign semantic roles to the phrases in the sentence based on PropBank conventions, we break down the sentence into its predicate-argument structure:

- Predicate: *awarded*
- Arguments:
  - The committee: Does the action, hence the agent.
  - The prize: What is being given, hence the theme.
  - The renowned scientist: Receiver of the theme, hence the recipient.
  - For her groundbreaking research on climate change: The reason for the action, which does not describe where, when, or how, but rather why the action was taken, which aligns with the purpose.

Now, we map them to the PropBank argument structures:
- **Arg0** usually represents the agent of the action (the doer of the action).
- **Arg1** represents the theme or the main entity that is affected by the action.
- **Arg2** in the context of verbs like "give" or "award" typically represents the recipient or the entity that receives something.
- **ArgM-PRP** stands for Purpose, indicating the reason or purpose behind the action.

Given this analysis, the correct assignment of the roles according to PropBank is:
- *The committee* should be labeled as **Arg0 (Agent)** since they are performing the action of awarding.
- *The prize* should be labeled as **Arg1 (Theme)** as it is what is being awarded.
- *To the renowned scientist* should be labeled as **Arg2 (Recipient)** since the scientist is the entity receiving the theme.
- *For her groundbreaking research on climate change* should be labeled as **ArgM-PRP (Purpose)** as it indicates the reason for the award.

## Correct Answer
4. *The committee* - Arg0 (Agent), *awarded* - Verb, *the prize* - Arg1 (Theme), *to the renowned scientist* - Arg2 (Recipient), *for her groundbreaking research on climate change* - ArgM-PRP (Purpose)

## Reasoning
The reasoning behind this choice is grounded in PropBank conventions for semantic role labeling. PropBank defines a set of core arguments (Arg0, Arg1, etc.) which are relatively consistent across different verbs, as well as a set of adjunct roles (ArgM-*) that capture additional descriptive information such as location, manner, and purpose.

- *The committee* performs the action (award), aligning with the role of **Agent (Arg0)**.
- *The prize* is the item that is being transferred from the agent to another entity, fitting the **Theme (Arg1)** role.
- *The renowned scientist* is clearly the receiver of the action, making her the **Recipient (Arg2)**.
- The phrase *for her groundbreaking research on climate change* describes the reason for the award being given out, fitting the definition of a **Purpose (ArgM-PRP)** role rather than other possible argument roles like Locative or Manner, indicating why the action occurred rather than where or how.

This analysis requires understanding of the roles and their applications beyond straightforward memorization, delving into practical application and inference based on the sentence's context.
