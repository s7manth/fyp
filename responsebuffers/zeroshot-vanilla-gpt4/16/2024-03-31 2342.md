## Question
In a transition-based dependency parsing scenario, a parser makes use of a buffer, a stack, and a set of actions (SHIFT, REDUCE, LEFT-ARC, RIGHT-ARC) to parse a sentence into its dependency tree. Given a sentence "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog", the parser is currently at a state where the stack contains ["ROOT", "The", "quick", "brown"], the buffer contains ["fox", "jumps", "over", "the", "lazy", "dog"], and no actions have been taken yet. What should be the next action taken by the parser, assuming it aims to minimize the number of overall parsing steps and adheres to a common strategy for optimal transition sequence, considering that the sentence is to follow standard English dependency grammars?

1. SHIFT
2. REDUCE
3. LEFT-ARC
4. RIGHT-ARC
5. The parser cannot proceed without additional information about the dependency relations.

## Solution

To determine the correct action, letâ€™s analyze the state of the parser and understand each action's effect:

- **SHIFT** moves the front of the buffer to the top of the stack. This is used when the parser decides it needs to see more of the input before it can make a decision on the relationships between words.
- **REDUCE** removes the top of the stack, used when the parser decides that the top stack item has all its dependencies resolved.
- **LEFT-ARC** and **RIGHT-ARC** are used to create dependency arcs between the top two items on the stack (the second-top item being dependent on the top item for LEFT-ARC, and vice versa for RIGHT-ARC). These actions also remove the second-top item (for LEFT-ARC) or the top item (for RIGHT-ARC) from the stack.

Given the context:

- The current stack top is "brown," and before it is "quick." In standard English dependency grammars, adjectives modify the nouns following them ("brown" modifies "fox"), suggesting a dependency relationship where "brown" is dependent on "fox."

Since "fox" is the next word in the buffer and "brown" needs to modify "fox," the correct course of action is to bring "fox" into play for establishing this dependency relationship. Hence, the sensible action is to use **SHIFT**, adding "fox" to the stack so it can then be made the parent of "brown" in subsequent steps (likely through a RIGHT-ARC, making "brown" a child of "fox").

## Correct Answer

1. SHIFT

## Reasoning

Choosing **SHIFT** as the next action aligns with the strategy of creating accurate dependency relations between words:

- **SHIFT** is the optimal choice because the parser recognizes the need to establish a dependency between the adjective "brown" and the forthcoming noun "fox." Without moving "fox" onto the stack, it cannot correctly form this relationship according to standard English dependencies, where modifiers (like adjectives) are connected to what they modify (like nouns).
- **REDUCE** would be premature as "brown" has not yet fulfilled its dependency role.
- **LEFT-ARC** and **RIGHT-ARC** are not applicable yet because the necessary dependency relationship (between "brown" and "fox") cannot be formed with the current stack's top elements.
- Additional information about dependency relations is not needed in this scenario because the decision is based on standard grammar rules and the immediate context provided by the stack and buffer contents.
