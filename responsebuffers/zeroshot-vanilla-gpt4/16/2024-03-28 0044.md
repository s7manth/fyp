## Question
Given a sentence "The cat sat on the mat.", you are implementing a graph-based dependency parser to analyze its syntactic structure. To evaluate the parser's performance, you decide to use labeled attachment score (LAS), unlabeled attachment score (UAS), and a new metric you developed called "Semantic Coherence Score" (SCS), which measures the degree to which the parsed dependencies conform to semantic expectations (e.g., subject-verb-object relationships). If the gold standard dependency tree for the sentence and the tree produced by your parser are both shown below, what are the LAS, UAS, and SCS scores for this parsing result?

Gold Standard Tree:
1. "The" is a determiner of "cat".
2. "cat" is the subject of "sat".
3. "sat" is the root.
4. "on" is a preposition attached to "sat".
5. "the" is a determiner of "mat".
6. "mat" is the object of the preposition "on".

Parser Output Tree:
1. "The" is a determiner of "cat".
2. "cat" is the subject of "sat".
3. "sat" is the root.
4. "on" is a preposition attached to "sat".
5. "the" is a determiner of "mat".
6. "mat" is the object of "sat".

Given that the SCS score is calculated based on correct semantic roles (with a penalty for semantically implausible relations, e.g., direct object relationship instead of prepositional object), choose the correct set of scores:

1. LAS: 100%, UAS: 100%, SCS: 100%
2. LAS: 83.33%, UAS: 100%, SCS: 83.33%
3. LAS: 83.33%, UAS: 100%, SCS: 66.67%
4. LAS: 100%, UAS: 83.33%, SCS: 83.33%
5. LAS: 100%, UAS: 83.33%, SCS: 100%

## Solution

**Step 1: Understand the metrics**

- **Labeled Attachment Score (LAS):** This evaluates the percentage of words in a sentence that are correctly attached to their head with the correct label.
- **Unlabeled Attachment Score (UAS):** This evaluates the percentage of words in a sentence that are correctly attached to their head, regardless of the label.
- **Semantic Coherence Score (SCS):** This is a custom metric that measures how well the dependencies match expected semantic relationships. For this problem, correct semantic roles are important, and there is a penalty for semantically implausible relations.

**Step 2: Analyze the trees**

There are 6 dependencies in both the gold standard tree and the parser output tree.

Comparing the two:
- All 6 dependencies in the parser output are correctly attached to their head (100% UAS).
- 5 out of 6 dependencies have the correct label, but the relationship between "mat" and "sat" is labeled incorrectly in the parser output. The "mat" should be the object of the preposition "on", not a direct object of "sat" (83.33% LAS).
- For SCS, there's a semantically implausible relation: "mat" is the direct object of "sat" instead of being the object of "on". This directly affects semantic coherence. Since only one out of six relations is semantically incorrect, the SCS is also 83.33%.

**Step 3: Calculate scores**

- LAS = (5/6) * 100 = 83.33%
- UAS = (6/6) * 100 = 100%
- SCS = (5/6) * 100 = 83.33% (assuming each correct semantic role contributes equally, and the penalty for the implausible relation reduces the score by the same proportion as LAS).

**Therefore, the correct set of scores is: LAS: 83.33%, UAS: 100%, SCS: 83.33%.**

## Correct Answer

2. LAS: 83.33%, UAS: 100%, SCS: 83.33%

## Reasoning

The correct answer is determined by comparing the dependency relations in the parser output tree with those in the gold standard tree. The Unlabeled Attachment Score (UAS) is 100% because every word in the parser output is correctly attached to its head. The Labeled Attachment Score (LAS) drops to 83.33% because the label for the dependency between "mat" and "sat" is incorrect according to the gold standard. The Semantic Coherence Score (SCS) is affected similarly to LAS because the incorrect dependency between "mat" and "sat" disrupts the expected semantic roles, leading to a decrease in semantic coherence. This comprehensive analysis ensures students understand not only how to calculate these metrics but also how to critically evaluate parsing results in terms of both syntactic correctness and semantic coherence.
