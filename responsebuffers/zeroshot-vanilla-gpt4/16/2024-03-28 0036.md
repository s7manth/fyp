## Question
Consider the scenario where you are implementing a hybrid dependency parser for a low-resource language. The parser combines both transition-based and graph-based approaches to leverage their respective strengths: the efficiency and simplicity of the transition-based approach and the global optimization capabilities of the graph-based approach. Given this context and your understanding of dependency relations, transition-based dependency parsing, graph-based dependency parsing, and evaluation methodologies in natural language processing (NLP), choose the option that best describes a plausible strategy for designing and evaluating such a hybrid dependency parser.

1. Use a transition-based parser to generate initial dependency trees for sentences and then apply a graph-based parser only on sentences where the transition-based parser has a high confidence in its predictions. Evaluate the parser using the BLEU score, focusing on the accuracy of specific dependency relations.
2. Design the parser to first apply a graph-based parsing technique to generate candidate dependency trees and then refine these trees using a transition-based approach, exploiting the speed of the latter for quick adjustments. Utilize precision, recall, and F1-score metrics for evaluation, with a focus on attachment scores.
3. Implement a system where the graph-based parser is used to generate features for the transition-based parser, essentially using the graph-based predictions as additional context for transition decisions. Evaluate the system using perplexity as the main metric to understand the parser's performance.
4. Apply a transition-based parser to generate a preliminary set of dependency relations, followed by a reinforcement learning mechanism that uses the graph-based parser to reward or penalize the transition-based parser's actions, aiming for a dynamic adjustment of parsing strategies. Evaluate the parser's effectiveness by comparing its output with a gold standard using edit distance.
5. Start with a graph-based parser to construct a global view of possible dependency trees and use a transition-based parser for real-time adjustments as the sentence is processed. Employ a combination of BLEU score and Word Error Rate (WER) for a comprehensive evaluation of the parser's accuracy and fluency.

## Solution

### Correct Answer
2. Design the parser to first apply a graph-based parsing technique to generate candidate dependency trees and then refine these trees using a transition-based approach, exploiting the speed of the latter for quick adjustments. Utilize precision, recall, and F1-score metrics for evaluation, with a focus on attachment scores.

### Reasoning
The correct strategy for designing a hybrid dependency parser that combines both transition-based and graph-based approaches would ideally leverage the global optimization capabilities of the graph-based parser to generate a comprehensive set of candidate dependency trees. Then, the transition-based parser can refine these trees, taking advantage of its operational speed and simplicity for making quick adjustments to individual dependencies. This approach allows the system to utilize the strengths of both parsing methods: the global perspective of the graph-based approach and the efficiency of the transition-based approach.

For the evaluation of such a hybrid dependency parser, precision, recall, and the F1-score are appropriate metrics, particularly focusing on attachment scores. Attachment scores are crucial in dependency parsing as they measure the accuracy of the parser in identifying the correct head (parent node) for each token (child node) in a sentence. Precision measures the proportion of correct dependency relations out of all the relations that the parser predicted, recall measures the proportion of correct dependency relations out of all the relations in the gold standard, and the F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a single metric to assess the parser's overall accuracy. These metrics are more relevant and informative for evaluating dependency parsers than the BLEU score, perplexity, or edit distance, which are typically used in other NLP tasks such as machine translation, language modeling, and text editing, respectively. BLEU score and Word Error Rate (WER), as mentioned in option 5, are not directly applicable to the task of dependency parsing, as they do not accurately reflect the structural and relational aspects critical to parsing performance.
