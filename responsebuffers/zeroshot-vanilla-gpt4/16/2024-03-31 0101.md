## Question

A team of computational linguists is developing a novel natural language processing (NLP) system focusing on enhancing the accuracy of dependency parsing for languages with free word order, such as Russian and Finnish. Their approach integrates both transition-based and graph-based dependency parsing strategies to leverage the advantages of each. At a certain stage in the parsing process, the system chooses between utilizing a transition-based approach for its speed and incremental parsing capabilities or a graph-based approach for its global optimization features, depending on the complexity of the sentence structure encountered.

Considering the system's design philosophy and the characteristics of the target languages, which of the following strategies would most likely improve the overall parsing accuracy of this hybrid system?

1. Always prefer the transition-based approach for its simplicity and lower computational cost, disregarding the sentence structure.
2. Utilize a machine learning model to predict the sentence complexity dynamically and choose the parsing strategy accordingly.
3. Implement a pre-processing step that standardizes sentence structures into a fixed order before applying any parsing strategy.
4. Rely exclusively on graph-based parsing for its comprehensive analysis capability, ignoring the transition-based approach.
5. Apply a transition-based approach first, then refine the parse using a graph-based method, regardless of the sentence complexity.

## Solution

The correct answer is: 2. Utilize a machine learning model to predict the sentence complexity dynamically and choose the parsing strategy accordingly.

## Correct Answer

2. Utilize a machine learning model to predict the sentence complexity dynamically and choose the parsing strategy accordingly.

## Reasoning

The question describes a novel system designed to parse languages with a free word order by leveraging both transition-based and graph-based approaches. Understanding the strengths of each approach is key to reasoning through the given options:

- Transition-based parsing is known for its speed and efficiency, making it suitable for simpler sentence structures where incremental building of the dependency tree can quickly lead to accurate results.
- Graph-based parsing, on the other hand, offers a global view of the sentence structure. It considers all possible structures before deciding on the best one, making it more suitable for sentences with complex or ambiguous structures, common in languages with free word order.

Given these characteristics, the most effective strategy for improving parsing accuracy in a hybrid system that targets languages with free word order would be to dynamically choose the parsing strategy based on the complexity of the sentence structure. This approach is found in option 2, where a machine learning model predicts sentence complexity to decide whether a transition-based or a graph-based approach should be applied. This dynamic selection allows the system to leverage the speed and efficiency of the transition-based approach for simpler sentences and the comprehensive, global optimization provided by the graph-based approach for more complex sentences.

Options 1, 3, and 4 each suggest relying on a single strategy or altering the sentence structure, which could lead to inefficiencies or loss of vital information, especially given the intrinsic complexity and flexibility of the target languages. Option 5 suggests a sequential application of both methods without considering sentence complexity, which could lead to unnecessary computational overhead for simpler sentences or inadequate parsing for complex ones, thus not optimizing the system's performance as effectively as the approach described in option 2.
