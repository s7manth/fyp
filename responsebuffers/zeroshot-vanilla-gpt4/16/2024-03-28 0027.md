## Question
Consider a scenario where you are tasked with developing a novel dependency parser that combines elements of both transition-based and graph-based approaches for an under-resourced language. The primary goal is to enhance the parsing accuracy while minimizing the need for extensive annotated corpora. Given this context, which of the following strategies would most effectively achieve the stated goal?

1. Utilize a transition-based approach with an added graph-based post-processing step to correct errors in attachment decisions.
2. Develop a hybrid model that uses a graph-based algorithm for global decisions and a transition-based system for local decisions, relying on reinforcement learning to dynamically choose between them.
3. Implement a graph-based approach with an added transition-based pre-processing step to provide initial guesses of dependency relations, which are later refined.
4. Design a system that first uses unsupervised machine translation to generate a pseudo-annotated corpus and then applies a standard transition-based algorithm for parsing.
5. Train a deep neural network model on a large, externally sourced corpus in a related high-resource language, applying transfer learning to adapt the model to the under-resourced language with a focus on transition-based parsing.

## Solution
To arrive at the correct answer, we need to consider the strengths and weaknesses of both transition-based and graph-based dependency parsing approaches, and how they can be effectively combined or supplemented to address the challenges of working with an under-resourced language.

- **Transition-based approaches** are known for their efficiency and are capable of making local decisions quickly. However, they can suffer from error propagation, as each decision is made based on the current state, without the ability to revise previous decisions.

- **Graph-based approaches** excel in making global decisions, optimizing the entire tree structure, which can lead to higher accuracy. The downside is that they typically require more computational resources and a larger annotated corpus to perform well.

Given these considerations, the strategies can be analyzed as follows:

1. **Utilizing a transition-based approach with a graph-based post-processing step** could mitigate some error propagation issues by allowing for global optimization after initial parsing. However, this approach does not directly address the challenge of limited resources.
  
2. **Developing a hybrid model** that dynamically chooses between graph-based and transition-based systems using reinforcement learning leverages the strengths of both systems. This approach could potentially optimize parsing accuracy by making both local and global decisions effectively. Reinforcement learning can help to adaptively improve the parsing strategy based on feedback, which is particularly beneficial in the context of an under-resourced language where annotated data is scarce.

3. **Implementing a graph-based approach with a transition-based pre-processing step** might provide useful initial guesses, but refining these guesses into accurate dependency relations might still require substantial annotated data to guide the graph-based refinement process.

4. **Using unsupervised machine translation to generate a pseudo-annotated corpus** addresses the issue of limited resources by creating more data. However, the quality of the pseudo-annotations and their suitability for training a dependency parser, especially a transition-based one that may not correct its mistakes, could be problematic.

5. **Training a deep neural network model on a large corpus in a related high-resource language and applying transfer learning** is a promising approach for dealing with under-resourced languages. However, this strategy does not inherently leverage the strengths of both parsing approaches to enhance parsing accuracy beyond what transfer learning might achieve.

Therefore, the most effective strategy that specifically targets both the enhancement of parsing accuracy and the minimization of the need for extensive annotated corpora by synthesizing the strengths of transition-based and graph-based parsing would be option 2.

## Correct Answer
2. Develop a hybrid model that uses a graph-based algorithm for global decisions and a transition-based system for local decisions, relying on reinforcement learning to dynamically choose between them.

## Reasoning
This approach is superior because it directly addresses the core objectives: enhancing parsing accuracy and dealing with the scarcity of annotated resources. By combining the local decision-making efficiency of transition-based systems with the global optimization strengths of graph-based systems, and using reinforcement learning to navigate between these strategies, the model can continually adapt and improve even with limited annotated data. This method effectively leverages the strengths of both parsing approaches, making it particularly well-suited for applications in under-resourced languages, where optimizing the use of available data is crucial.
