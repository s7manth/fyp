## Question
Given a sentence "The cat sat on the mat.", a team of researchers is implementing a custom dependency parser to analyze its grammatical structure. They opt for a graph-based parsing approach due to its global optimization abilities but face challenges with non-projective dependency relations that occur due to linguistic phenomena such as free word order in some languages. To address this, they incorporate an algorithm capable of handling non-projective trees. Which of the following algorithms did the team MOST likely integrate into their parser to efficiently tackle the non-projective dependency parsing problem while optimizing for global sentence structure?

1. Earley parser algorithm
2. Chu-Liu/Edmonds' algorithm
3. Shift-reduce parser algorithm
4. Cocke-Younger-Kasami (CYK) algorithm
5. Greedy transition-based parsing algorithm

## Solution

To solve this problem, we need to understand both projective and non-projective dependency relations, and identify which algorithms are capable of handling non-projective dependencies, especially in the context of graph-based parsing, which optimizes for global structure in sentences.

**Dependency Parsing**: In the realm of dependency parsing, we distinguish between projective and non-projective dependency trees. Projective trees are those where the words and their dependents form a contiguous sequence in the sentence, without crossing lines if drawn above the sentence. Non-projective trees occur when such a condition is not met, often due to linguistic phenomena like free word order.

**Graph-Based Parsing**: This approach constructs a graph for a given sentence and finds the optimal tree structure that represents its grammatical dependencies. It is known for its capability to analyze the global structure of a sentence rather than making decisions based only on local information, as is often the case in shift-reduce (transition-based) parsing.

**Chu-Liu/Edmonds' Algorithm**: Specifically designed for finding the maximum spanning tree in a directed graph, this algorithm can efficiently handle non-projective dependencies by optimizing for the best tree structure that covers all the words in a sentence. This makes it particularly suitable for languages with free word order or where non-projective constructions are common.

1. **Earley parser algorithm**: This is primarily used for constituency parsing and not specifically designed to handle non-projective dependencies in graph-based parsing.
2. **Chu-Liu/Edmonds' algorithm**: Correct for addressing non-projective dependencies in graph-based parsing. It finds the optimal tree structure in a directed graph, which aligns with the requirements for handling sentences with potentially non-projective dependencies.
3. **Shift-reduce parser algorithm**: This is a staple in transition-based parsing, which typically focuses on local decision-making rather than global optimization and might not inherently handle non-projective dependencies efficiently without specific modifications.
4. **Cocke-Younger-Kasami (CYK) algorithm**: It is more aligned with constituency parsing and parsing context-free grammars, not specifically tailored for dependency parsing or non-projective dependencies.
5. **Greedy transition-based parsing algorithm**: While capable of parsing sentences, it makes decisions based on local information and is not optimized for global structure like graph-based methods, nor is it explicitly designed to handle non-projective dependencies without substantial modification.

## Correct Answer
2. Chu-Liu/Edmonds' algorithm

## Reasoning
The Chu-Liu/Edmonds' algorithm is explicitly designed to find the maximum spanning tree in a directed graph, making it an optimal choice for graph-based dependency parsing where non-projective dependencies are a concern. Its ability to efficiently and accurately determine the best overall structure for a sentence containing potentially non-projective dependencies makes it uniquely suited to address the challenges faced by the researchers. This choice leverages the global optimization strengths of graph-based parsing while effectively managing the complexity introduced by non-projective linguistic phenomena.
