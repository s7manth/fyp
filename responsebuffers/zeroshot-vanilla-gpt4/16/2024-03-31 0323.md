## Question

Given a partially completed transition-based dependency parse with the configuration (stack | buffer | dependencies) as below:

- Stack: [ROOT, discussed]
- Buffer: [the, paper, with, John]
- Dependencies: {('discussed', 'ROOT')}

Which of the following actions, when applied, would **NOT** be a valid move according to the standard arc-standard algorithm rules for transition-based dependency parsing, considering the goal is to eventually yield a parse tree corresponding to the sentence "discussed the paper with John"?

1. SHIFT
2. LEFT-ARC('discusses')
3. RIGHT-ARC('agent')
4. REDUCE
5. RIGHT-ARC('theme')

## Solution

To determine the correct answer, we analyze each of the possible actions concerning the current configuration:

**Current Configuration:**

- Stack: [ROOT, discussed]
- Buffer: [the, paper, with, John]
- Dependencies: {('discussed', 'ROOT')}

**1. SHIFT:** Moves the next word from the buffer to the top of the stack. This action is valid as the buffer is not empty, and the algorithm has not fully parsed the sentence.

**Action effect:** Stack = [ROOT, discussed, the], Buffer = [paper, with, John]

**2. LEFT-ARC('discusses'):** Adds a dependency between the top two words on the stack with the second word depending on the first and then removes the second word. This action is not valid because the 'discussed' cannot have a dependency labeled 'discusses' with 'ROOT', which is already its parent with an unspecified label in this configuration. 

**3. RIGHT-ARC('agent'):** Adds a dependency between the top two words on the stack with the first word depending on the second and keeps both on the stack. This action could be considered incorrect because 'agent' is not an appropriate relation between 'ROOT' and 'discussed'. However, this depends on the verb's semantic role; 'agent' typically links to a subject, which is not what is being represented here, but the action itself follows the rules of transition-based parsing.

**4. REDUCE:** Removes the top word from the stack. This action is invalid at this point because 'discussed' has not yet found all its dependents. The REDUCE action is only appropriate when the word at the top of the stack has all of its dependents in the dependency graph.

**5. RIGHT-ARC('theme'):** Correctly identifies a dependency relation where 'discussed' (on the stack) is the theme of the action rooted by 'discusses' (hypothetical future addition or existing parent in the tree). However, given the issue with RIGHT-ARC('agent') and the correctness within an NLP framework, this action would be a valid parsing action in adding a dependency with 'theme' to a future word from the buffer that acts as the object of 'discussed'.

Thus, the actions which might initially seem invalid based on a misunderstanding of roles or prematurely considering the sentence context are SHIFT, LEFT-ARC('discusses'), and REDUCE.

## Correct Answer

4. REDUCE

## Reasoning

The REDUCE action is typically used when the top of the stack does not expect any more children (i.e., all of its dependent have been connected via arcs). In this case, considering 'discussed' still needs to establish a dependency with other words in the buffer to complete the parse tree for the sentence correctly, using a REDUCE action prematurely would contravene the algorithm's objective of building a dependency tree that accurately reflects the sentence's grammatical structure. Hence, without 'discussed' having found all its dependents, a REDUCE operation would not correctly progress the parsing toward an accurate parse tree, making it the invalid option in this scenario.
