## Question

Given a complex sentence, "Despite the heavy rains, the festival attracted thousands from around the country, making it a surprising success." a natural language processing (NLP) system is tasked to perform dependency parsing to analyze its syntactic structure. Assume the system uses a graph-based parsing approach. Which of the following statements best describes the steps and considerations the system might undertake to accurately parse this sentence, and how it evaluates its parsing performance?

1. The system first identifies all nouns and verbs to create nodes in the graph, then uses a set of handcrafted rules to determine the edges between nodes based on their proximity in the sentence. It evaluates its performance using Precision and Recall, where Precision measures the percentage of relations it identified correctly, and Recall measures the percentage of actual relations it identified.
2. The system constructs a complete graph where each word is a node, and every possible directed edge between nodes is considered. It then assigns weights to these edges based on a scoring function learned from a training corpus. The best parse is found by selecting the maximum spanning tree (MST) of this graph. The system evaluates its performance using the F1 score, combining Precision and Recall into a single metric.
3. The system uses a transition-based approach where it iteratively builds a dependency tree by applying a series of actions (SHIFT, REDUCE, LEFT-ARC, RIGHT-ARC) guided by a machine learning model until all words are connected in a tree structure. It then evaluates the tree using BLEU score, comparing it with a reference tree to see how many n-grams are correctly predicted.
4. The system creates a bipartite graph with verbs on one side and nouns on the other, then draws edges based on likely subject-verb and object-verb pairs as determined by a probabilistic model. It evaluates its success based on a custom metric that accounts for both the depth of the dependency tree and the number of correctly identified subject-verb-object triples.
5. The system first conducts a part-of-speech tagging on each word, then constructs a directed graph where each word is a node. It utilizes a deep learning model to predict the type and direction of edges (dependencies) between these nodes. Performance evaluation is based on the accuracy of dependency types and the Unlabeled Attachment Score (UAS), which measures the percentage of words correctly attached to their head.

## Solution

The most accurate description of how a graph-based parsing system would parse the given sentence and evaluate its performance is given in option 2. 

The graph-based parsing approach involves constructing a graph where each word in the sentence forms a node. The system then considers every possible directed edge between these nodes, effectively creating a complete graph. Edges are weighted based on a scoring function, which is learned from a training corpus that provides examples of correctly parsed sentences. The best parse, i.e., the most likely syntactic structure of the sentence, is identified by finding the maximum spanning tree (MST) of this graph. The MST is chosen because it connects all the nodes in the graph (words in the sentence) in such a way that the total weight (probability of the dependency relations being correct) is maximized, and there are no cycles, ensuring a tree structure that a syntactic parse requires.

For evaluating its performance, the system uses the F1 score. The F1 score is a harmonic mean of Precision and Recall, making it a robust measure that balances the two. Precision is the proportion of predicted relations that are correct, while Recall is the proportion of actual relations that were correctly identified by the parser. The F1 score provides a single metric to assess the overall performance of the parser in terms of its accuracy in identifying correct dependency relations.

## Correct Answer

2. The system constructs a complete graph where each word is a node, and every possible directed edge between nodes is considered. It then assigns weights to these edges based on a scoring function learned from a training corpus. The best parse is found by selecting the maximum spanning tree (MST) of this graph. The system evaluates its performance using the F1 score, combining Precision and Recall into a single metric.

## Reasoning

The key concepts behind graph-based parsing include the construction of a graph with nodes (words) and weighted edges (potential dependencies), and the selection of an MST to determine the actual dependencies. This process is based on learned weights that predict the likelihood of dependencies, using information from a training corpus. The performance evaluation using the F1 score makes sense because parsing accuracy involves both identifying the correct dependencies among the possible ones (Precision) and ensuring no correct dependencies are missed (Recall). The other options either describe different parsing techniques not applicable to the given scenario (e.g., transition-based parsing) or propose evaluation metrics that are not standard or appropriate for assessing the performance of a dependency parser (e.g., BLEU score, custom metrics, or only using UAS without considering dependency types).
