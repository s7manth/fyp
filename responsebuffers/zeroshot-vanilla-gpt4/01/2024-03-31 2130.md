## Question

In a Natural Language Processing (NLP) system tasked with analyzing and responding to customer queries in a large online retail environment, text normalization is a crucial step to improve the system's understanding and responsiveness. Consider a scenario where the system has to correctly interpret the text: "I luv my new air-pods! They're absolutely amaaaazing!!! ðŸ˜Š". Which of the following text normalization steps, applied in a sequence, would be most effective for preparing this text for further NLP tasks like sentiment analysis or keyword spotting?

1. Tokenization, removing special characters, lemmatization, converting emojis to text, lowercasing.
2. Removing special characters, tokenization, spell correction, lemmatization, lowercasing.
3. Converting emojis to text, lowercasing, tokenization, spell correction, stemming.
4. Spell correction, converting emojis to text, tokenization, stemming, removing special characters.
5. Lowercasing, converting emojis to text, removing special characters, tokenization, lemmatization.

## Solution

To approach this solution, it's essential to understand what each text normalization step does and the order that makes sense for processing the given text in a way that retains critical sentiment and content cues.

- **Lowercasing:** Converts all characters in the text to lowercase. This step is crucial for uniformity, especially in case-sensitive languages.
- **Tokenization:** Splits the text into smaller units, such as words or terms.
- **Removing special characters:** Strips out punctuation and other non-alphanumeric symbols, which can be important for clean tokenization but might remove sentiment-carrying "!!!", so it should be applied judiciously.
- **Spell correction:** Adjusts misspelled words to their correct form ("luv" to "love"), important for standardization.
- **Lemmatization:** Reduces words to their base or dictionary form, which is crucial for recognizing different forms of a word as the same token.
- **Stemming:** Similar to lemmatization but more crude; it cuts words down to their stem, sometimes resulting in non-words.
- **Converting emojis to text:** Transforms emojis to their descriptive text, which can be critical for sentiment analysis and should be done before removing special characters and tokenization to retain the sentiment they carry.

Given these steps, the most effective sequence for the example text is:

1. **Converting emojis to text** - This ensures that the sentiment carried by the emoji ("ðŸ˜Š" to "happy") is retained.
2. **Lowercasing** - This standardizes the text.
3. **Tokenization** - Important for breaking the text into manageable pieces.
4. **Spell correction** - Ensures words like "luv" are standardized to "love".
5. **Stemming** - Simplifies words to their stem, but in this context could be less optimal than lemmatization; however, no option offers lemmatization at the correct step after spell correction without prior unwanted steps.

Given the importance of retaining sentiment and accurately interpreting customer queries, the best option among those given is:

3. Converting emojis to text, lowercasing, tokenization, spell correction, stemming.

## Correct Answer

3. Converting emojis to text, lowercasing, tokenization, spell correction, stemming.

## Reasoning

This sequence starts with converting emojis to text to retain sentiment. Lowercasing is then applied to standardize the casing across the text. After standardizing the casing, the text is tokenized into manageable pieces. Spell correction follows to correct words like "luv" to "love", standardizing the vocabulary. Finally, stemming is applied to reduce words to their stems, although it might not be as accurate as lemmatization in all cases. This sequence efficiently retains sentiment and standardizes the text, making it more accessible for subsequent NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis or keyword spotting.
