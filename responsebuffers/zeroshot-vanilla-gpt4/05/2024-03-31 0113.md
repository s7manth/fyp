## Question
You are tasked with designing a recommendation system for a new online library platform. The goal is to recommend books that are topically similar to the books a user has enjoyed in the past. You decide to use natural language processing techniques to analyze book descriptions. After initial explorations, you narrow down your approach to leveraging vector embeddings to create a semantic space for book descriptions. Given the importance of both accuracy and computational efficiency for the system's scalability, which of the following strategies would best serve your objectives?

1. Use high-dimensional TF-IDF vectors for each book description and compute recommendations based on cosine similarity.
2. Implement a Word2Vec model trained on a large external corpus of literature, then average the vectors of all words in a book description to represent each book.
3. Employ Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) to create dense vector representations of book descriptions, directly comparing these vectors with Euclidean distance for recommendation.
4. Utilize pre-trained, low-dimensional GloVe embeddings for a more efficient computation of vector similarities between book descriptions.
5. Apply a custom-trained BERT model to encode book descriptions into embeddings, then use cosine similarity for determining the closest books.

## Solution
To determine the best strategy, let's evaluate each choice based on the required balance between accuracy and computational efficiency:

1. **High-dimensional TF-IDF vectors & cosine similarity:** This approach, while simple and interpretable, could suffer from the curse of dimensionality and sparsity, leading to high computational costs and potentially less accurate recommendations as not all words (especially the less frequent ones) carry meaningful topical information.

2. **Word2Vec & averaging vectors:** Word2Vec creates meaningful, dense vector space representations of words based on their contexts. By averaging the vectors of words in a book description, we lose some specificity but gain a computationally efficient and semantically rich representation of texts. However, it might not fully capture the nuances of longer texts such as book descriptions.

3. **PMI & Euclidean distance:** PMI is effective in capturing relationships between words, but using it to create dense vector representations of entire texts can be less straightforward and computationally intensive. Additionally, Euclidean distance is less preferred for measuring similarity in high-dimensional space due to the curse of dimensionality.

4. **Pre-trained GloVe embeddings:** GloVe embeddings provide a good balance between the richness of semantic representations and computational efficiency, thanks to their lower dimensionality compared to raw TF-IDF vectors and the advantage of being pre-trained on a large corpus. This can be especially beneficial for a system that needs scalability.

5. **Custom-trained BERT & cosine similarity:** While BERT offers state-of-the-art language understanding capabilities, training and inferring with BERT (especially custom models) can be very computationally expensive and might not be necessary for the task of recommending books based on descriptions, where simpler models could be nearly as effective and much more efficient.

Considering these points, **pre-trained GloVe embeddings (choice 4)** appear to offer the best trade-off between accuracy (through meaningful semantic embeddings) and computational efficiency, essential for scalability in a recommendation system.

## Correct Answer
4. Utilize pre-trained, low-dimensional GloVe embeddings for a more efficient computation of vector similarities between book descriptions.

## Reasoning
Pre-trained GloVe embeddings are chosen due to their efficiency and effectiveness for the task at hand. GloVe vectors are trained on a vast corpus, thus encapsulating rich semantic relationships in a lower-dimensional space than high-dimensional TF-IDF vectors, making computations faster and more scalable. Unlike Word2Vec and PMI, GloVe embeddings don't require training on the specific dataset, which saves significant computational resources. Moreover, they are more effective at capturing semantics across larger texts (e.g., book descriptions) compared to the averaging of Word2Vec vectors. Unlike BERT, which could provide highly accurate representations but at a substantial computational cost, GloVe strikes the right balance for a recommendation system that values both semantic accuracy and computational efficiency.
