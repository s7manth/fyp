## Question
A research team is designing a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model to understand the semantic similarity between different pieces of text in a large corpus. The team decides to use vector embeddings to capture the semantic content of texts, but they are concerned about potential biases that might be encoded in these embeddings. They aim to evaluate these embeddings' ability to capture semantic similarity while also investigating any potential biases. Which of the following approaches would best help the team achieve both goals?

1. Applying Cosine Similarity on TF-IDF vectors while ignoring the gender-specific pronouns in the preprocessing step.
2. Utilizing Word2vec embeddings, followed by dimensionality reduction using PCA, and manually checking for gender or ethnic biases in the reduced-dimensional space.
3. Implementing Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) to generate vectors, followed by a bias detection algorithm that specifically checks for biases in word associations.
4. Training custom Word2vec embeddings on a bias-corrected corpus and using Cosine Similarity to measure the semantic similarity between the text embeddings.
5. Utilizing pre-trained GloVe embeddings and applying the WEAT (Word Embedding Association Test) to detect biases, coupled with Cosine Similarity to assess semantic similarity.

## Solution
The research team's goals are two-fold: measure semantic similarity and investigate potential biases within embeddings. Given these requirements, a solution needs to address both semantic similarity measurement and bias detection:

- **Cosine Similarity** is an effective measure for semantic similarity, working well with different kinds of vector representations like TF-IDF and Word2vec embeddings. However, simply applying Cosine Similarity is not sufficient to detect biases.
- **TF-IDF vectors** capture the importance of words within documents but do not inherently capture deep semantic relationships or biases in the same way as word embeddings like Word2vec or GloVe.
- **Word2vec embeddings** capture semantic relationships between words based on their context but can also encode biases present in the training data. Simply using PCA for dimensionality reduction might simplify visualization but does not inherently address bias.
- **PMI** is useful for capturing word associations but, like TF-IDF, does not directly address biases without additional steps.
- **Bias detection algorithms** and **bias-corrected corpora** are direct approaches to identifying and mitigating biases in embeddings.
- **WEAT (Word Embedding Association Test)** is a widely recognized method for detecting biases in word embeddings, making it a pertinent choice for this evaluation.

Given the criteria, **Choice 5** is the most comprehensive approach. Utilizing pre-trained **GloVe embeddings** allows the team to leverage existing embeddings that capture rich semantic relationships. Applying **WEAT** provides a methodological way to detect biases regarding race, gender, and more within these embeddings. Finally, measuring semantic similarities through **Cosine Similarity** fulfills the team's objective to assess semantic content accurately.

## Correct Answer
5. Utilizing pre-trained GloVe embeddings and applying the WEAT (Word Embedding Association Test) to detect biases, coupled with Cosine Similarity to assess semantic similarity.

## Reasoning
This option effectively balances the need to assess semantic similarity and the necessity of detecting biases within embeddings:

- **GloVe embeddings** are powerful in capturing word semantics based on global word-word co-occurrence statistics, providing a strong foundation for semantic similarity analysis.
- **Cosine Similarity** is a standard and effective metric for measuring the semantic similarity between vectors, fitting well with the analysis of embedding-derived vectors.
- **WEAT** enables the detection of biases in word embeddings by comparing the relative similarity of sets of target words (e.g., "man", "woman") to sets of attribute words (e.g., "work", "home"), making it a suitable choice for the team's objective to investigate biases.
- This choice ensures that the team can achieve a comprehensive evaluation of their embeddings, addressing both primary objectives without compromising one for the other.
