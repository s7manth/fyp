## Question
Consider the scenario where a data scientist is working on building a semantic search engine for academic papers. The primary goal is to develop a system that can accurately retrieve documents based on the semantic similarity of their content to a search query. For this, the scientist decides to use vector embeddings generated from the text of the papers. After some research and experimentation, the data scientist narrows down to two main approaches for generating these embeddings:

1. **TF-IDF Vectors:** Where each document is represented as a vector indicating the frequency of selected terms adjusted by their inverse document frequency across the corpus.
   
2. **Word2Vec Embeddings:** Specifically, using an averaged Word2Vec model where each word in the document is first mapped to a pre-trained word embedding, and the document's representation is calculated as the mean of its word embeddings.

Given the following characteristics of the academic papers:
- They cover a wide range of topics from various disciplines.
- They often contain specialized vocabulary unique to specific fields.
- The semantic search engine is expected to understand nuanced differences in search queries.

Which approach, between TF-IDF vectors and averaged Word2Vec embeddings, is likely to perform better for the semantic search engine, and why?

1. TF-IDF vectors, because they are better at capturing document-specific term importance.
2. Averaged Word2Vec embeddings, because they are more capable of understanding the semantic relationships between words.
3. TF-IDF vectors, due to their simplicity and ease of implementation for a wide variety of documents.
4. Averaged Word2Vec embeddings, as they are less affected by the presence of rare or specialized terms.
5. Both approaches will perform equally well as long as the vector dimensions are properly optimized.

## Solution

The correct answer is **2. Averaged Word2Vec embeddings, because they are more capable of understanding the semantic relationships between words.**

### Reasoning

To arrive at this conclusion, let's examine each method and its suitability for the key requirements of the semantic search engine project outlined:

**TF-IDF Vectors:**
- TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectors represent documents based on the frequencies of terms adjusted by their rarity across the corpus. It emphasizes words that are unique to a document but doesn't inherently understand the meaning or semantic relationships between words. While this method excels at highlighting document-specific keywords, it struggles with understanding context or the nuances in meaning, which are critical for the semantic search capability required here.

**Averaged Word2Vec Embeddings:**
- Word2Vec generates word embeddings that capture a multitude of syntactic and semantic word relationships, effectively mapping words with similar meanings close to each other in the vector space. By taking an average of the Word2Vec embeddings of words in a document, we obtain a dense vector representation that encapsulates the overall semantic essence of the document. This method is superior in grasping the subtle semantic differences between the documents, which aligns well with the project's need to understand nuanced differences in search queries and content of academic papers that often deal with complex topics.

Given the scenario's emphasis on understanding semantic similarity and capturing nuanced differences in meaning across diverse disciplines and specialized vocabularies, **Averaged Word2Vec embeddings** are better suited. They inherently understand semantic relationships, which TF-IDF vectors do not, making them more adept for this particular application of semantic search across academic papers.

## Correct Answer

2. Averaged Word2Vec embeddings, because they are more capable of understanding the semantic relationships between words.
