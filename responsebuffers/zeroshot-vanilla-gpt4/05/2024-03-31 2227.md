## Question
In an effort to analyze natural language processing embeddings' ability to capture semantic relationships and biases, a researcher decides to perform an experiment using Word2Vec embeddings trained on a large corpus. They aim to explore gender stereotypes within these embeddings by examining the semantic similarity between profession names and gender-associated words. Given that the cosine similarity metric is used to measure the semantic closeness between two vectors, which of the following sets of word pairs is MOST likely to demonstrate evidence of gender stereotypes when evaluating the trained Word2Vec model?

1. `('doctor', 'man')` and `('nurse', 'woman')`
2. `('engineer', 'blue')` and `('teacher', 'red')`
3. `('engineer', 'man')` and `('teacher', 'woman')`
4. `('bread', 'butter')` and `('salt', 'pepper')`
5. `('cat', 'pet')` and `('brick', 'build')`

## Solution

The question examines the student's understanding of semantic properties of embeddings, the application of cosine similarity in measuring these properties, and the critical issue of bias within trained language models. To solve the question, the student must:

1. Understand that Word2Vec embeddings capture semantic relationships by learning representations of words in a space where the distance (or closeness) between vectors correlates with semantic similarity.
2. Recognize that cosine similarity measures how similar two vectors are, regardless of their magnitude, which makes it a suitable metric for comparing the semantic similarity between words.
3. Recall that biases in embeddings result from the data they were trained on; if the training data contained gender stereotypes, these could be reflected in the word embeddings.
4. Evaluate each set of word pairs in the options to determine which most directly aligns professions with explicit gender terms, potentially reflecting societal gender stereotypes.

Option 1 (`('doctor', 'man')` and `('nurse', 'woman')`) directly contrasts professions with gender-associated words and is likely to reflect traditional gender stereotypes present in training data. Option 2 involves colors, which are unrelated to the concept of gender bias in professions. Option 3, similar to option 1, contrasts professions with genders directly, making it another plausible choice that reflects gender stereotypes. Option 4 deals with food items, and option 5 compares unrelated objects and actions, neither of which pertain to gender stereotypes in the context of professions.

Therefore, while both options 1 and 3 are valid in exploring gender stereotypes within embeddings, option 3 (`('engineer', 'man')` and `('teacher', 'woman')`) is more representative of widely discussed gender biases in professional fields, thus making it the most likely to demonstrate evidence of gender stereotypes when analyzing the trained Word2Vec model.

## Correct Answer

3. `('engineer', 'man')` and `('teacher', 'woman')`

## Reasoning

Option 3 is selected because it directly aligns with the experiment's aim to uncover gender stereotypes within profession names. `Engineer` and `man`, `teacher` and `woman` are word pairs that, due to societal stereotypes often present in large text corpora, are likely to exhibit closer cosine similarities in the embeddings space. This choice underscores the critical notion that machine learning models, including Word2Vec, can inherit and perpetuate biases present in their training data. This option not only tests the student's understanding of how embeddings capture semantic meaning but also encourages critical thinking about the ethical implications of applying NLP technologies.
