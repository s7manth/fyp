## Question

In a research project, an NLP scientist is analyzing a large corpus of social media posts using various vector semantic models to understand the evolving linguistic representation of mental health issues over the last decade. They aim to capture semantic shifts, identify emerging terminology, and assess sentiment trends related to mental health discussions. Given the objectives and the dynamic nature of language on social media, which combination of techniques is most appropriate for effectively capturing these linguistic changes and why?

1. Applying Word2Vec models separately on data from different years, followed by aligning these models using orthogonal Procrustes and analyzing the semantic shifts through cosine similarity measures.
2. Generating a single TF-IDF vector representation for the entire corpus, then segmenting this representation by year to track the frequency and relevance of terms related to mental health.
3. Using a static Word2Vec model trained on the entire corpus, and applying t-SNE visualization to compare the cluster movements of mental health-related terms across different years.
4. Calculating Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) for mental health-related terms across different years directly, without considering the context or the embeddings' semantic properties.
5. Training a single large BERT model on the entire corpus and leveraging its attention mechanism to extract embeddings for mental health-related terms, analyzing changes in attention patterns over years.


## Solution

The key objectives in this scenario involve understanding semantic shifts, identifying emerging terminology, and assessing sentiment trends related to mental health discussions on social media. This requires capturing the dynamic nature of language and how specific contexts influence the meanings and associations of terms over time.

1. **Applying Word2Vec models separately on data from different years, followed by aligning these models using orthogonal Procrustes and analyzing the semantic shifts through cosine similarity measures**: This approach allows the scientist to capture the evolving representations of words in different periods accurately. By training Word2Vec models for each year and then aligning these models, they can directly compare the semantic spaces of different time periods. Cosine similarity measures will help in quantifying the shifts in meaning or associations of specific terms related to mental health.
   
2. **Generating a single TF-IDF vector representation for the entire corpus, then segmenting this representation by year**: This method primarily focuses on the frequency and relevance of terms but does not capture semantic shifts or the evolving linguistic nuances associated with mental health discussions.

3. **Using a static Word2Vec model trained on the entire corpus, and applying t-SNE visualization**: This approach does not adequately capture the year-by-year evolution of language. A single static model may miss the subtle changes and emerging nuances in how mental health topics are discussed over the decade.

4. **Calculating PMI for terms across different years directly**: While PMI can highlight the associations between terms, this method does not adequately capture the semantic shifts or the evolving context in which mental health discussions occur. It is also less effective in analyzing large, dynamic corpora where the context and language use change rapidly.

5. **Training a single large BERT model on the entire corpus**: While BERT captures contextual information effectively, analyzing changes in attention patterns over years may not be as straightforward or as effective in capturing subtle semantic shifts or the emergence of new terminology as the first approach. Additionally, this does not directly address aligning semantic spaces across different time periods.

### Correct Answer

1. Applying Word2Vec models separately on data from different years, followed by aligning these models using orthogonal Procrustes and analyzing the semantic shifts through cosine similarity measures.

### Reasoning

This approach is best suited for capturing the dynamic semantic shifts in discussions about mental health on social media. By training separate Word2Vec models for each year, one can capture the specific linguistic context and nuances relevant to that timeframe. Aligning these models using orthogonal Procrustes allows for a direct comparison between the semantic spaces of different years, addressing the need to understand how the representation of mental health issues evolves. Finally, analyzing these aligned models through cosine similarity provides a quantitative measure of semantic shifts, helping identify not just emerging terminology but also changes in sentiment and the contextual associations of mental health-related terms. This method effectively combines the objectives of capturing semantic shifts, identifying new terminology, and analyzing sentiment trends, making it the most comprehensive and suitable for the described research goals.
