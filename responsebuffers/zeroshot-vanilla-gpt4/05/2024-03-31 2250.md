## Question

Given a collection of documents being processed for sentiment analysis, a student decides to use Word2Vec to generate word embeddings, aiming to capture semantic relationships between words. After training, the student notices that some expected semantic relationships, like synonyms and antonyms, are not as accurately represented in the resulting vector space as expected. To improve the representation of these semantic relationships in the embeddings space, the student considers several modifications to their approach. Which of the following modifications is most likely to improve the accuracy of capturing synonyms and antonyms in the word embeddings?

1. Increase the dimensionality of the Word2Vec embeddings significantly.
2. Apply TF-IDF weighting to the Word2Vec embeddings post-training.
3. Integrate contextual embeddings from models like BERT into the analysis.
4. Increase the size of the training corpus with more diverse documents.
5. Manipulate the window size in Word2Vec to capture more local context around each word.

## Solution

To answer this question, we should consider how each proposed solution impacts the representation of semantic relationships, particularly synonyms and antonyms, within word embeddings.

1. **Increasing dimensionality**: While higher dimensions can capture more nuances in word meanings, simply increasing dimensions doesn't directly address the distinguishability between synonyms and antonyms. It mainly improves the model's capacity to represent complex relationships but may not specifically improve synonym and antonym representation unless the dimensionality was initially too low.

2. **Applying TF-IDF weighting**: TF-IDF is primarily designed to highlight important words in documents and diminish the impact of frequently occurring words that are less informative about semantic content. Applying TF-IDF to embeddings post-training does not inherently improve the model's ability to distinguish between synonyms and antonyms. 

3. **Integrating contextual embeddings**: Models like BERT produce contextual word embeddings, meaning that the embeddings can capture the meaning of a word in the specific context in which it appears. This is highly beneficial for distinguishing between synonyms and antonyms, as the same word may have different meanings (and thus different synonyms and antonyms) in different contexts.

4. **Increasing the size of the training corpus**: While a larger and more diverse training corpus can improve the overall quality of word embeddings by providing more examples of word usage, it doesn't specifically target the improvement of synonym and antonym representation unless the corpus lacks examples of such relationships.

5. **Manipulating the window size**: Adjusting the window size in Word2Vec affects how much context the model considers when determining the meaning of a word. However, while a larger window size might help capture more contextual information, it does not directly improve the model's ability to differentiate between synonyms and antonyms like contextual embeddings do.

Based on the analysis above, the modification most likely to improve the accuracy of capturing synonyms and antonyms in the word embeddings is **integrating contextual embeddings from models like BERT into the analysis**.

## Correct Answer

3. Integrate contextual embeddings from models like BERT into the analysis.

## Reasoning

Contextual embeddings from models like BERT are specifically designed to understand the context in which a word is used. This is critically important for accurately capturing synonyms and antonyms since the true meaning of a word—and thus its most accurate synonyms and antonyms—can vary significantly depending on the sentence in which it appears. While the other options might improve the quality of the embeddings in general ways, integrating contextual embeddings directly addresses the challenge of representing the nuanced meanings that differentiate synonyms from each other and from their antonyms, thus providing a targeted solution to the observed issue.
