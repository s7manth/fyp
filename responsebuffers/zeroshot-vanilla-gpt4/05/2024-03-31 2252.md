## Question
In an investigation of semantic properties and biases within word embeddings, a linguistic researcher is evaluating pre-trained Word2Vec models. To assess the extent of gender bias, the researcher is examining directional similarities between profession names and gendered words. Assuming the Word2Vec embeddings have captured biases present in the training data, which of the following operations would most likely reveal a gendered association with the profession "nurse" as opposed to "engineer"? Consider that $v(x)$ represents the embedding of word $x$.

1. $\cos(v(\text{"nurse"}), v(\text{"man"})) > \cos(v(\text{"engineer"}), v(\text{"woman"}))$
2. $\cos(v(\text{"nurse"}), v(\text{"woman"})) > \cos(v(\text{"engineer"}), v(\text{"man"}))$
3. $\cos(v(\text{"nurse"}), v(\text{"he"})) - \cos(v(\text{"nurse"}), v(\text{"she"}))$
4. $\cos(v(\text{"nurse"}), v(\text{"power"})) > \cos(v(\text{"engineer"}), v(\text{"care"}))$
5. $\cos(v(\text{"nurse"}) - v(\text{"woman"}), v(\text{"engineer"}) - v(\text{"man"}))$

## Solution
The objective is to detect gender bias by comparing the association between professions and gender-specific words through the lens of Word2Vec embeddings. Bias in embeddings can be quantitatively assessed using cosine similarity, which measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors and thus indicates the degree of similarity between them. The cosine similarity ranges from -1 (perfectly dissimilar) to 1 (perfectly similar).

Choice 2, "$\cos(v(\text{"nurse"}), v(\text{"woman"})) > \cos(v(\text{"engineer"}), v(\text{"man"}))$", directly compares the similarity of the profession "nurse" with "woman" and "engineer" with "man," which aligns with historical and societal biases that associate nursing more closely with women and engineering with men. This choice effectively tests the hypothesis of gender bias in the embeddings by analyzing the direction and strength of the associations between specific professions and gendered words.

Let's break down why the other choices are less suitable:

1. Choice 1 compares "nurse" to "man" and "engineer" to "woman," which inverts the traditionally biased associations. While insightful for other analyses, it doesn't directly target the expected bias in question.
   
3. Choice 3 calculates the difference in cosine similarities of "nurse" with gendered pronouns "he" and "she." While this could reveal bias, it's a less direct method compared to comparing professions with gendered words. Also, it doesn't take into account the comparison with "engineer."

4. Choice 4 assesses the association of "nurse" and "engineer" with non-gendered concepts ("power" and "care"). This choice focuses on a different type of semantic relationship and does not specifically address gender bias.
   
5. Choice 5 uses a vector subtraction approach to isolate gender associations by subtracting gender word vectors from profession vectors before calculating similarity. Although an interesting approach for removing bias or examining specific dimensions of similarity, it does not directly measure the existing bias in a straightforward manner like Choice 2.

Therefore, Choice 2 is the most direct and effective method to uncover the specific type of gender bias within the embedding space relevant to the professions "nurse" and "engineer."

## Correct Answer
2. $\cos(v(\text{"nurse"}), v(\text{"woman"})) > \cos(v(\text{"engineer"}), v(\text{"man"}))$

## Reasoning
Choice 2 is the best approach for detecting gender bias within word embeddings for a few key reasons:

- It directly assesses the cosine similarity between professions and gendered words, thus effectively quantifying the degree of association based on angle cosine within the vector space.
- The comparison aligns with common societal biases, making it a relevant choice for examining the presence of such biases in word embeddings.
- It provides a clear, direct measure of bias by comparing the similarities of professions with gendered words that are stereotypically associated with them, offering a straightforward interpretation of the result.
- This method aligns with the objectives of computational linguistics research that seeks to understand and mitigate bias in AI models, making it a practical choice for evaluating and addressing issues of fairness and representation in NLP technologies.
