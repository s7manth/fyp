## Question

In the context of natural language processing (NLP), imagine you are working on a project to analyze sentiments in movie reviews using vector semantics and embeddings. To improve the accuracy of sentiment analysis, you decide to implement a custom model that combines different concepts from the topics covered in the course. You plan to enhance word representations by integrating Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) weighted vectors and word embeddings from a pre-trained Word2vec model. Considering the combination of these techniques, which of the following steps best describes an effective method to leverage TF-IDF weighted vectors alongside Word2vec embeddings for sentiment analysis?

1. Directly add the TF-IDF scores to the corresponding Word2vec vectors for each word and use these modified embeddings as inputs to the sentiment analysis model.
2. Train a new Word2vec model where the initial weights of the embeddings are set to the TF-IDF scores of the corresponding words in the corpus.
3. Convert both TF-IDF and Word2vec embeddings to a common high-dimensional space and compute the element-wise multiplication to form enhanced embeddings.
4. Use TF-IDF scores to filter out less important words before averaging the Word2vec embeddings of the remaining words in a document for sentiment analysis.
5. Cluster the Word2vec embeddings using a method like K-means and assign TF-IDF scores as weights to the clusters rather than individual words when analyzing documents.

## Solution

To solve this question, students need to understand the strengths and functions of both Word2vec embeddings and TF-IDF weighted vectors, as well as how they can complement each other in an NLP task like sentiment analysis.

- **Word2vec** embeddings capture semantic similarities between words based on their context in large corpora. However, they do not account for the importance of a word in a document relative to the entire corpus.

- **TF-IDF** scores, on the other hand, measure the importance of a word within a document in the context of a larger corpus, which can help in weighting the significance of words in a sentiment analysis task.

Considering the proper application of these methods:

- **Option 1** might initially seem plausible, but directly adding TF-IDF scores to Word2vec embeddings could distort the semantic spaces that Word2vec captures, as the scales of the two metrics are different.

- **Option 2** presents an intriguing concept but misinterprets how Word2vec works; Word2vec's training process doesn't start with predetermined weights that reflect the importance of words, but rather learns embeddings through context prediction.

- **Option 3** involves a non-standard approach with potential dimensionality and scale issues, making this method impractical for combining the two types of embeddings.

- **Option 4** represents an effective method for utilizing both Word2vec and TF-IDF. By using the TF-IDF scores to filter out less significant words, the model focuses on the more meaningful words in the document. The average of the Word2vec embeddings of these filtered words would likely capture the central sentiments of the document accurately while incorporating the significance of terms via TF-IDF.

- **Option 5** introduces an interesting idea but might complicate the relationship between words and their sentiment contributions by clustering embeddings and applying TF-IDF scores to clusters rather than words, which could obscure nuances in sentiment analysis.

Therefore, Option 4 is the most effective method described for leveraging TF-IDF weighted vectors alongside Word2vec embeddings for sentiment analysis.

## Correct Answer

4. Use TF-IDF scores to filter out less important words before averaging the Word2vec embeddings of the remaining words in a document for sentiment analysis.

## Reasoning

Option 4 provides a practical integration of TF-IDF and Word2vec for sentiment analysis. By filtering out less significant words using TF-IDF scores, this approach maintains the contextually-rich semantic information encoded in Word2vec embeddings for the remaining words. This method focuses on the relevance and context of words, combining the strengths of TF-IDF's document-specific importance metrics with the semantic depth of Word2vec embeddings, offering an efficient and meaningful way to analyze sentiments in texts. This balanced approach allows for an improved sentiment analysis by concentrating on semantically rich and relevant words, aligning with both the theoretical understanding and practical applications of vector semantics and embeddings in NLP.
