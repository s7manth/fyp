## Question
In the context of using Word2Vec for creating word embeddings, a researcher is analyzing the semantic properties of the generated vectors to identify potential biases. The dataset being used contains a diverse collection of news articles from multiple decades. The researcher hypothesizes that the embeddings may exhibit historical biases that were prevalent in the news media of past decades. To test this hypothesis, the researcher decides to examine the cosine similarity between specific word pairs.

Which of the following sets of word pairs should the researcher primarily focus on to effectively identify and analyze historical biases within the embeddings?

1. Commonly used nouns in the present decade vs. commonly used nouns in past decades.
2. Profession-related terms (e.g., 'doctor', 'engineer') and gender-specific pronouns ('he', 'she').
3. Synonyms of positive adjectives across different decades.
4. Technology-related terms from each decade and neutral adjectives.
5. Randomly selected pairs of words from the corpus.

## Solution
The researcher should focus on analyzing the cosine similarity between profession-related terms and gender-specific pronouns. This approach allows the identification of gender biases associated with professions in the embeddings, which can reflect historical biases prevalent in the news media of the past decades. By computing the cosine similarity between words like 'doctor' or 'engineer' and gender-specific pronouns like 'he' or 'she', the researcher can gauge how closely these professions are associated with a particular gender in the embedding space. A high cosine similarity between 'doctor' and 'he', for instance, might suggest a bias towards associating the profession of a doctor more with males than females, reflecting historical gender biases in society and media representation.

## Correct Answer
2. Profession-related terms (e.g., 'doctor', 'engineer') and gender-specific pronouns ('he', 'she').

## Reasoning
The choice of focusing on profession-related terms and gender-specific pronouns to identify historical biases within the embeddings is grounded in the understanding of how biases can be encoded in language and, consequently, in word embeddings. Word2Vec, by design, captures the co-occurrence patterns of words within a corpus. If the corpus (in this case, a collection of news articles from multiple decades) exhibits a tendency to associate certain professions with a specific gender, this bias will be reflected in the word embeddings generated by Word2Vec.

Analyzing cosine similarity between profession terms and gender-specific pronouns allows for an effective examination of gender biases, as this method directly addresses the relational aspect of words in the vector space. High cosine similarity scores indicate a closer relationship in the vector space, revealing underlying biases in how professions are gendered in the corpus data.

This approach aligns with recent research in NLP that seeks to uncover and mitigate biases in machine learning models, particularly in embeddings. It extends beyond simple frequency analysis (option 1), looks directly at bias instead of general semantic shifts over time (option 3), avoids the irrelevance of technology terms to bias analysis (option 4), and is more structured than a random approach (option 5).
