## Question

An NLP research team is developing a model to gauge the semantic relatedness between academic papers to enhance a recommendation system for a digital library. The team decides to represent documents as vectors using tf-idf scoring for words in the documents and then determine the similarity between papers using cosine similarity. To further refine their model, they consider incorporating word embeddings by leveraging pre-trained Word2Vec models. They hypothesize that this combination can capture both the importance of specific terms (through tf-idf) and the semantic relatedness of concepts (through word embeddings).

Which of the following approaches would MOST effectively combine tf-idf scores and Word2Vec embeddings to improve the document similarity measurements for the recommendation system?

1. Calculate the average Word2Vec embedding for each document, then concatenate this vector with the tf-idf vector for the document before computing cosine similarities.
2. For each word in the documents, add its Word2Vec embedding vector to its tf-idf score, then compute the cosine similarity between the resulting document vectors.
3. Replace the tf-idf scores with their corresponding Word2Vec embeddings, then compute the cosine similarity between the document vectors represented solely by Word2Vec embeddings.
4. Compute the cosine similarity between documents using tf-idf scores and separately using Word2Vec embeddings, then take the average of these two similarity scores for the final recommendation.
5. Multiply the tf-idf score of each word by its corresponding Word2Vec embedding vector, aggregate these products for each document, and then calculate the cosine similarity between the resulting document vectors.

## Solution

To effectively combine tf-idf and Word2Vec embeddings, the chosen method must leverage the strengths of both approaches: tf-idf's ability to highlight the importance of specific terms in the document, and Word2Vec's capability to capture the semantic relatedness of words. The goal is to create a methodology that allows both the significance of unique terms and the contextual meanings of terms to contribute to the document similarity measurements.

1. **Concatenation of Average Embedding with tf-idf Vector**: This method allows a combination of both types of information but could result in an imbalance where either the tf-idf or the average embedding dominates the similarity measurement due to differences in vector space dimensions and magnitude.
   
2. **Adding Embedding Vector to tf-idf Score**: This approach is not practical because it suggests adding a scalar (tf-idf score) to a vector (Word2Vec embedding), which is mathematically infeasible.
   
3. **Replacing tf-idf Scores with Word2Vec Embeddings**: This method eliminates the tf-idf scores entirely, losing the specific term importance in favor of purely semantic relationships. This doesnâ€™t combine the approaches but rather replaces one with another.
   
4. **Average of Cosine Similarities from tf-idf and Word2Vec**: This method retains the individually computed similarities from both models and averages them. While this allows for considering both tf-idf and Word2Vec, it may not leverage the complementary information as effectively as a more integrated approach.
   
5. **Multiplying tf-idf Score by Word2Vec Embeddings**: This method scales the embedding vectors of each word by its tf-idf score, thereby integrating the importance of words (from tf-idf scores) with the semantic relatedness (from Word2Vec embeddings). Aggregating these scaled embeddings for each document allows the creation of a document vector that reflects both the significance of terms and their semantic relationships. Computing cosine similarity between these vectors should provide a more nuanced measurement of document similarity.

**Option 5** seems most effective for combining tf-idf scores and Word2Vec embeddings because it directly merges the significance of terms (through tf-idf weighting) and semantic relatedness (through embeddings) at the word level. This combined approach should enhance the document similarity measurement for the recommendation system by capturing both the importance and the context of the words in the documents.

## Correct Answer

5. Multiply the tf-idf score of each word by its corresponding Word2Vec embedding vector, aggregate these products for each document, and then calculate the cosine similarity between the resulting document vectors.

## Reasoning

The reasoning behind choosing option 5 is the integration of key strengths of both tf-idf and Word2Vec models. By scaling the Word2Vec embeddings with the tf-idf scores, each word's contribution to the document vector is weighted by its importance in the document (as determined by tf-idf), while still capturing the semantic relationships between words (as encoded in the Word2Vec embeddings). This method enriches the document representation by maintaining both the specific importance of terms within the documents and their broader semantic meanings. Consequently, when these enriched document vectors are used to compute cosine similarity, the similarity measurements are more nuanced, capturing both direct term relevance and semantic relatedness, which is critical for refining the recommendation system in the given scenario.
