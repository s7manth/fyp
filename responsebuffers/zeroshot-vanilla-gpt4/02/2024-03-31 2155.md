## Question
Given a corpus of text from technical manuals and natural language processing (NLP) research papers, you are tasked with building and evaluating an N-gram language model to generate new sentences that mimic the style and content found in these documents. You decide to use a trigram model and apply Kneser-Ney smoothing to account for the zero-probability issue of unseen N-grams. After training your model, you want to compare its performance against a baseline bigram model that also uses Kneser-Ney smoothing.

Which of the following metrics and techniques would NOT be appropriate for evaluating the relative performance of the trigram model against the bigram model in this scenario?

1. Calculating the perplexity of both models on a held-out test set to compare their predictive capabilities.
2. Using a human evaluation panel to rate the fluency and technical accuracy of sentences sampled from each model.
3. Applying cross-validation, by splitting the corpus into k subsets, to ensure robustness of the perplexity estimates.
4. Employing a t-test on the perplexity scores obtained across several shuffles of the training and test sets to statistically assess improvements.
5. Generating a distribution of next-word probabilities for a fixed context from both models, and comparing these distributions using Jensen-Shannon divergence.

## Solution

To evaluate which method would not be appropriate, we need to consider the specific contexts and capabilities of the language models in question, as well as the nature of the performance metrics mentioned.

1. **Calculating the perplexity of both models on a held-out test set**: This is a standard and widely accepted method for comparing the performance of language models. Perplexity measures how well a probability model predicts a sample and is a direct reflection of the model's predictive capabilities.

2. **Using a human evaluation panel**: While more subjective, this method is essential for evaluating aspects of the generated text that automated metrics might miss, such as fluency and technical accuracy, particularly in specialized domains like technical manuals and research papers.

3. **Applying cross-validation**: Though cross-validation is a standard technique for ensuring the generalizability of a model, its application in the context of evaluating language models, especially for large datasets typical of NLP tasks, might be impractical due to computational constraints. However, it is not inherently inappropriate.

4. **Employing a t-test on perplexity scores**: This statistical test can compare the means of two datasets, which in this case, are the perplexity scores of the two models. It's a valid approach to assess if the differences in performance are statistically significant.

5. **Generating a distribution of next-word probabilities and comparing using Jensen-Shannon divergence**: While this could provide insights into the models' behavior in specific contexts, it's more of an analysis tool than a performance evaluation metric. Jensen-Shannon divergence measures the similarity between two probability distributions, but in the context of evaluating the overall performance of N-gram models, it does not directly address either model's ability to generate coherent and accurate text.

## Correct Answer

3. Applying cross-validation, by splitting the corpus into k subsets, to ensure robustness of the perplexity estimates.

## Reasoning

The correct choice is cross-validation. The rationale behind its inappropriateness here lies in the nature of language models and the practical constraints involved. N-gram models, particularly those trained on large corpora, require substantial computational resources both for training and generating predictions. Applying cross-validation would involve training the model multiple times on different segments of the corpus, which could be computationally expensive and time-consuming. More critically, the continuity and coherence of textual data in NLP tasks make simple k-fold cross-validation less suitable, as it could disrupt the sequential nature of the text. Hence, while cross-validation is a valuable method in many machine learning scenarios for ensuring the model's generalizability and robustness, its direct application in evaluating N-gram language models is less practical and not as common as other evaluation strategies such as perplexity measurement and human evaluation.
