## Question
Consider a scenario where you are developing a multinomial logistic regression model to classify news articles into multiple categories based on their content. Your model utilizes the cross-entropy loss function to measure its performance and applies L2 regularization to avoid overfitting. After training, you aim to interpret the model's coefficients to understand the influence of specific terms on the classification.

Given that the model's output probabilities are calculated using the softmax function, and the optimization is performed using gradient descent, which of the following statements is *INCORRECT* about the process of developing and interpreting this model?

1. The gradient of the cross-entropy loss with respect to the model parameters can be used to update the model weights during the gradient descent steps.
2. The softmax function's output can be interpreted as the probability distribution over the possible classes for a given input.
3. Larger coefficients for a given term in the model imply a higher relevance of that term in predicting classes that have a higher probability.
4. Adding L2 regularization to the model affects the gradient of the loss function by subtracting a portion of the weights from the original gradient calculated without regularization.
5. The cross-entropy loss function is convex, ensuring that the gradient descent will converge to the same global minimum regardless of the initial starting points of the parameters.

## Solution
To determine the incorrect statement, let's analyze each option:

1. **Correct**: The gradient of the cross-entropy loss with respect to the model parameters provides the direction in which the model weights need to be updated to minimize the loss. This is a fundamental concept in gradient descent optimization.

2. **Correct**: The softmax function is specifically used in multinomial logistic regression to convert the raw output scores from the model into probabilities by normalizing them across all classes. Each output can indeed be interpreted as the model's estimated probability of the corresponding class given the input.

3. **Correct**: In logistic regression models, including multinomial logistic regression, the size (and sign) of the coefficients directly correlates with the influence of the corresponding features on the prediction. Larger coefficients imply a stronger influence on increasing the probability of the classes they are associated with, assuming all features are on the same scale.

4. **Correct**: L2 regularization is applied by adding a penalty term to the loss function, which is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the coefficients. When calculating the gradient of the regularized loss, the derivative of this penalty term with respect to the weights (2 times the weight due to the square in L2 regularization) is subtracted from the gradient of the unregularized loss, affecting the update rule in gradient descent.

5. **Incorrect**: While the cross-entropy loss function is convex for binary logistic regression, stating that it ensures convergence to the same global minimum for multinomial logistic regression regardless of initialization is incorrect. In the context of multinomial logistic regression, especially with complex feature sets and high dimensionality, the loss surface can have multiple local minima. The statement might hold true under specific conditions for binary logistic regression but is overly general and misleading for multinomial logistic regression.

## Correct Answer
5. The cross-entropy loss function is convex, ensuring that the gradient descent will converge to the same global minimum regardless of the initial starting points of the parameters.

## Reasoning
The key to identifying the incorrect statement lies in understanding the properties of logistic regression, the softmax function, the nature of L2 regularization, the role of coefficients, and the landscape of the loss function in optimization. While the first four statements accurately describe their respective concepts and their implications in the context of multinomial logistic regression, the fifth statement misrepresents the nature of the optimization landscape in multinomial logistic regression by suggesting a guarantee of converging to a global minimum regardless of initialization, which is not always true due to the potential presence of multiple local minima.
