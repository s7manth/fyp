## Question

Given a text classification problem where the goal is to classify news articles into one of four categories: politics, tech, sports, and health, you are employing multinomial logistic regression. Your feature set is derived from TF-IDF scores of the words in the corpus, and you have also decided to use L2 regularization to mitigate overfitting due to the high dimensionality of the feature space. The regularization parameter $\lambda$ is set to 0.1. 

Assuming your dataset has been properly preprocessed and split into training and test sets, you begin training your model using gradient descent. Taking one of the steps in the gradient descent process, you realize the importance of correctly updating the weight vector to move towards the optimum.

Which of the following equations correctly represents the weight update rule in the scenario described above?

1. $w = w - \alpha \cdot (\nabla J(w) + \lambda \cdot w)$
2. $w = w + \alpha \cdot (\nabla J(w) - \frac{1}{\lambda} \cdot w)$
3. $w = w - \alpha \cdot (\nabla J(w) - \lambda \cdot w)$
4. $w = w - \alpha \cdot \nabla J(w)$
5. $w = w - \alpha \cdot (\nabla J(w) + \frac{1}{\lambda} \cdot w)$

## Solution

To solve this, we need to recall the role of gradient descent in training machine learning models and how regularization is incorporated into weight updates.

1. **Gradient Descent**: The general update rule for gradient descent without regularization is $w = w - \alpha \cdot \nabla J(w)$, where $w$ is the weight vector, $\alpha$ is the learning rate, and $\nabla J(w)$ is the gradient of the loss function with respect to $w$. This rule is about adapting weights to minimize the loss.

2. **L2 Regularization**: The purpose of L2 regularization is to penalize large weights in the model to prevent overfitting. It is added to the loss function as $\lambda \cdot ||w||_2^2$, where $\lambda$ is the regularization parameter. When calculating the gradient of the loss function with this regularization term included, the derivative of the L2 penalty with respect to $w$ is $2 \lambda \cdot w$.

3. **Weight Update with Regularization**: Given this, the weight update formula including the L2 regularization becomes $w = w - \alpha \cdot (\nabla J(w) + \lambda \cdot 2 \cdot w)$. However, it's common practice to just include $\lambda$ rather than $2\lambda$ in the formula for simplicity and readability, understanding that the actual derivative includes this multiplication by 2. Thus, the equation simplifies to the update rule considering L2 regularization: $w = w - \alpha \cdot (\nabla J(w) + \lambda \cdot w)$.

Given these points, the correct equation for the weight update rule in the scenario with L2 regularization is:
$$w = w - \alpha \cdot (\nabla J(w) + \lambda \cdot w)$$

## Correct Answer

1. $w = w - \alpha \cdot (\nabla J(w) + \lambda \cdot w)$

## Reasoning

The correct update rule incorporates both the gradient of the loss function and the L2 regularization term. The addition of $\lambda \cdot w$ to the gradient of the loss function $\nabla J(w)$ before scaling by the learning rate $\alpha$ correctly adjusts the weights by considering both the error reduction and penalty for large weights. Choice 1 encapsulates the concept of minimizing the regularized loss function by including the regularization term directly in the weight update formula, which aligns with the principles of L2 regularization in the context of gradient descent.
