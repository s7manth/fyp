## Question

A data scientist is developing a natural language processing (NLP) model to classify news articles into multiple categories (e.g., politics, sports, technology, and health) based on their content. After preprocessing the text data, the scientist decides to use multinomial logistic regression for the classification task. To optimize the model's parameters, the data scientist decides to implement stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with L2 regularization due to its efficiency on large datasets. Given the following log-likelihood equation for multinomial logistic regression:

$$L(\theta) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{k=1}^{K} y_{ik} \log\left(\frac{\exp(\theta_{k} \cdot x_{i})}{\sum_{j=1}^{K} \exp(\theta_{j} \cdot x_{i})}\right)$$

where $N$ is the number of samples, $K$ is the number of classes, $y_{ik}$ is a binary indicator of whether class $k$ is the correct classification for instance $i$, and $x_{i}$ is a feature vector for instance $i$, the data scientist adds an L2 regularization term, $\lambda \sum_{k=1}^{K} ||\theta_{k}||^2_2$, to the loss function to prevent overfitting. 

The data scientist then derives the gradient of the regularized loss function with respect to $\theta_{k}$ to update the parameters using SGD. What is the resulting gradient formula that should be used for updating $\theta_{k}$?

1. $\nabla_{\theta_{k}} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} x_{i} \left( y_{ik} - \frac{\exp(\theta_{k} \cdot x_{i})}{\sum_{j=1}^{K} \exp(\theta_{j} \cdot x_{i})} \right) - 2\lambda \theta_{k}$
2. $\nabla_{\theta_{k}} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} x_{i} \left( y_{ik} - \frac{\exp(\theta_{k} \cdot x_{i})}{\sum_{j=1}^{K} \exp(\theta_{j} \cdot x_{i})} \right) + \lambda \theta_{k}$
3. $\nabla_{\theta_{k}} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} x_{i} \left( \frac{\exp(\theta_{k} \cdot x_{i})}{\sum_{j=1}^{K} \exp(\theta_{j} \cdot x_{i})} - y_{ik} \right) + 2\lambda \theta_{k}$
4. $\nabla_{\theta_{k}} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} x_{i} \left( \frac{\exp(\theta_{k} \cdot x_{i})}{\sum_{j=1}^{K} \exp(\theta_{j} \cdot x_{i})} - y_{ik} \right) - 2\lambda \theta_{k}$
5. $\nabla_{\theta_{k}} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} x_{i} \left( y_{ik} - \frac{\exp(\theta_{k} \cdot x_{i})}{\sum_{j=1}^{K} \exp(\theta_{j} \cdot x_{i})} \right)$

## Solution

To derive the gradient needed for updating $\theta_{k}$ in the context of stochastic gradient descent with L2 regularization for multinomial logistic regression, one should start from the log-likelihood equation given and include the regularization term in the loss function:

$$L(\theta) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{k=1}^{K} y_{ik} \log\left(\frac{\exp(\theta_{k} \cdot x_{i})}{\sum_{j=1}^{K} \exp(\theta_{j} \cdot x_{i})}\right) - \lambda \sum_{k=1}^{K} ||\theta_{k}||^2_2$$

The partial derivative of the loss with respect to $\theta_{k}$ must consider both the derivative of the original log-likelihood term and the derivative of the regularization term:

1. For the log-likelihood part, applying the derivative leads to:
$$\nabla_{\theta_{k}}^{\text{likelihood}} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} x_{i} \left( y_{ik} - \frac{\exp(\theta_{k} \cdot x_{i})}{\sum_{j=1}^{K} \exp(\theta_{j} \cdot x_{i})} \right)$$

2. For the L2 regularization term, the derivative is straightforward, considering the 2-norm squared of $\theta_{k}$, leading to:
$$\nabla_{\theta_{k}}^{\text{regularization}} = 2\lambda \theta_{k}$$

Combining these, the full update rule (gradient of the loss) that takes into account both the likelihood and the regularization part is:
$$\nabla_{\theta_{k}} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} x_{i} \left( y_{ik} - \frac{\exp(\theta_{k} \cdot x_{i})}{\sum_{j=1}^{K} \exp(\theta_{j} \cdot x_{i})} \right) - 2\lambda \theta_{k}$$

Thus, the correct gradient formula for updating $\theta_{k}$ is:
$$\nabla_{\theta_{k}} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} x_{i} \left( y_{ik} - \frac{\exp(\theta_{k} \cdot x_{i})}{\sum_{j=1}^{K} \exp(\theta_{j} \cdot x_{i})} \right) - 2\lambda \theta_{k}$$

Therefore, the correct answer is 1.

## Correct Answer

1. $\nabla_{\theta_{k}} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} x_{i} \left( y_{ik} - \frac{\exp(\theta_{k} \cdot x_{i})}{\sum_{j=1}^{K} \exp(\theta_{j} \cdot x_{i})} \right) - 2\lambda \theta_{k}$

## Reasoning

This solution derives the gradient of the regularized loss function for multinomial logistic regression by carefully considering both the original log-likelihood term and the L2 regularization term. The L2 regularization is incorporated to prevent overfitting by penalizing large coefficients. The combination of derivatives from the log-likelihood and L2 regularization terms gives the full gradient formula needed for parameter updates in SGD, perfectly illustrating the application of derivative calculus in optimizing complex, regularized loss functions in machine learning models. This solution demonstrates the necessary synthesis of theoretical knowledge and practical application required for developing efficient and robust NLP classification models.
