## Question
In the context of optimizing a logistic regression model for binary classification, you are experimenting with different loss functions to better handle a dataset with imbalanced classes. The traditional cross-entropy loss function is given by:

$$-\sum_{i=1}^{N}\left[y^{(i)}\log(p^{(i)}) + (1-y^{(i)})\log(1-p^{(i)})\right]$$

where $N$ is the number of samples, $y^{(i)}$ is the actual label, and $p^{(i)}$ is the predicted probability for the positive class for the $i^{th}$ sample.

To address the challenge of class imbalance, you are considering the introduction of class weights into the loss function. Which of the following modified loss functions correctly applies class weighting to balance the impact of classes?

1. $$-\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}\left[w_0\cdot y^{(i)}\log(p^{(i)}) + w_1\cdot(1-y^{(i)})\log(1-p^{(i)})\right]$$
2. $$-\sum_{i=1}^{N}\left[(1+w_0)\cdot y^{(i)}\log(p^{(i)}) + (1+w_1)\cdot(1-y^{(i)})\log(1-p^{(i)})\right]$$
3. $$-\sum_{i=1}^{N}\left[\frac{y^{(i)}\log(p^{(i)})}{w_0} + \frac{(1-y^{(i)})\log(1-p^{(i)})}{w_1}\right]$$
4. $$-\sum_{i=1}^{N}\left[y^{(i)}\log(w_0\cdot p^{(i)}) + (1-y^{(i)})\log(w_1\cdot(1-p^{(i)}))\right]$$
5. $$-\sum_{i=1}^{N}\left[y^{(i)}\log(p^{(i)})^{w_0} + (1-y^{(i)})\log(1-p^{(i)})^{w_1}\right]$$

## Solution

The correct answer can be identified by understanding how class weights ($w_0$ and $w_1$) should be incorporated into the loss function to correct for class imbalances effectively.

The cross-entropy loss function aims to penalize wrong predictions, with a higher penalty for being confident and wrong. In the case of class imbalance, this principle remains; however, we wish to adjust the penalty based on the frequency of classes. The weights $w_0$ and $w_1$ are introduced to scale the penalty for misclassifications of each class, where typically, $w_0$ could be for the minority class and $w_1$ for the majority class, or vice versa based on how one decides to weight the importance of each class.

The modified loss function should apply these weights directly to scale the contribution of each class to the loss, without altering the fundamental mechanism of the cross-entropy loss, which involves the actual label $y^{(i)}$, and the predicted probability $p^{(i)}$.

Looking at the choices:
- Choice 1 directly scales the component of the loss contributed by each class according to $w_0$ for the positive class and $w_1$ for the negative class, maintaining the structure of the cross-entropy loss. This aligns with the requirement to weight the classes differently based on their prevalence.
- Choice 2 introduces an additive factor to the weights, which would not correctly adjust the impact of the loss by class frequency but instead offsets the loss, misrepresenting the intended mechanism.
- Choice 3 inversely weights the loss, which would diminish the impact of the weighting rather than emphasize the imbalanced classes as intended.
- Choice 4 incorrectly attempts to scale the probabilities before applying the logarithm, which does not correctly apply class weighting within the cross-entropy framework.
- Choice 5 modifies the exponent of the log term by the class weights, which is not a valid manipulation of the cross-entropy loss formula for adjusting class weights. 

Thus, the correctly modified loss function that applies class weighting is Choice 1.

## Correct Answer

1. $$-\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}\left[w_0\cdot y^{(i)}\log(p^{(i)}) + w_1\cdot(1-y^{(i)})\log(1-p^{(i)})\right]$$

## Reasoning

The reason that Choice 1 is the correct answer is because it incorporates class weights directly into the loss function in a way that uses these weights to adjust the impact of each class proportionally. This represents an effective strategy for handling class imbalance, by scaling the penalties for misclassifications for each class according to their assigned weights. This modification does not fundamentally alter the behavior of the cross-entropy loss but adjusts the loss proportional to the importance of correctly classifying instances from each class, seen in how $w_0$ and $w_1$ scale the log terms corresponding to positive and negative classes, respectively.
