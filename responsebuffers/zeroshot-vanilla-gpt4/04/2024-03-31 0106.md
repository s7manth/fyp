## Question

Given a dataset of customer reviews for various movies, a data scientist is tasked with building a sentiment analysis model using logistic regression. Each review is labeled as either positive or negative. To improve the model's performance, the data scientist decides to apply $L2$ regularization to the logistic regression model. The regularization strength parameter, $\lambda$, is set to a specific value.

Given the following information, which statement best describes the impact of applying $L2$ regularization to the logistic regression model for this sentiment analysis task?

1. $L2$ regularization will ensure that the sentiment analysis model's weights for each word in the reviews are equally important, thereby preventing overfitting.
2. $L2$ regularization will make the model's decision boundary linear, regardless of the original distribution of the sentiment in the dataset.
3. $L2$ regularization will penalize large weights in the model, potentially leading to a more generalized model that is less likely to overfit to the training data.
4. $L2$ regularization adds bias to the model, which will result in higher variance in the prediction errors, making it less reliable for sentiment analysis.
5. $L2$ regularization will eliminate the need for feature selection, as it automatically removes irrelevant features by setting their weights to zero.

## Solution

To understand the impact of applying $L2$ regularization to a logistic regression model, it's essential to comprehend what $L2$ regularization is and how it affects the model's learning process.

$L2$ regularization, also known as ridge regularization, adds a penalty term to the cost function equivalent to the square of the magnitude of the coefficients (weights). The regularization term is controlled by a parameter $\lambda$, which determines the strength of the regularization. The modified cost function looks like this:

$$ J(\theta) = -\frac{1}{m}[\sum_{i=1}^{m} y^{(i)}\log(h_{\theta}(x^{(i)})) + (1 - y^{(i)})\log(1 - h_{\theta}(x^{(i)}))] + \frac{\lambda}{2m}\sum_{j=1}^{n} \theta_j^2 $$

where $J(\theta)$ is the cost function, $m$ is the number of training examples, $n$ is the number of features, $y^{(i)}$ is the actual label of the $i^{th}$ training example, $h_{\theta}(x^{(i)})$ is the predicted probability of $i^{th}$ example belonging to the positive class, and $\theta_j$ are the parameters (weights) of the model.

$L2$ regularization aims to prevent overfitting by penalizing large weights. By doing so, it encourages the model to maintain smaller weights, leading to a simpler model that generalizes better to unseen data. The key impacts of $L2$ regularization include:

- Ensuring model complexity is kept in check by penalizing the sum of the squares of the model weights, which helps in reducing overfitting.
- Unlike $L1$ regularization, $L2$ does not lead to sparse solutions; it does not set the weights to zero but shrinks them.
- It does not make the decision boundary linear if it wasn't already linear. The decision boundary's shape is determined by the logistic function and the dataset's distribution.
- Regularization does not eliminate the need for feature selection; irrelevant features will still have non-zero weights, albeit smaller.

Given these points, the correct statement regarding the impact of applying $L2$ regularization to the logistic regression model for sentiment analysis is:

3. $L2$ regularization will penalize large weights in the model, potentially leading to a more generalized model that is less likely to overfit to the training data.

## Correct Answer

3. $L2$ regularization will penalize large weights in the model, potentially leading to a more generalized model that is less likely to overfit to the training data.

## Reasoning

The reasoning behind the selection of option 3 as the correct answer lies in understanding the primary goal and mechanism of $L2$ regularization. By adding a penalty equivalent to the sum of the squares of the weights to the cost function, $L2$ regularization ensures that the model does not fit the training data too closely. This regularization method forces the weights to be smaller, which simplifies the model. A simpler model is less likely to capture the noise in the training data, making it more capable of performing well on unseen data, thereby reducing the likelihood of overfitting. It's crucial to note that $L2$ regularization influences the magnitude of the weights but does not directly lead to feature selection or ensure equal importance of features as incorrectly suggested in the other options.
