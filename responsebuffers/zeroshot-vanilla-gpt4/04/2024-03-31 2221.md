## Question

Consider a multinomial logistic regression model that is being trained to classify news articles into one of three categories: "Politics", "Technology", or "Sports". The model uses a feature vector $\mathbf{x}$ derived from the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) of words in the articles and applies the softmax function to predict probabilities of each class. During the training process, the model employs the cross-entropy loss function and L2 regularization for preventing overfitting, with a regularization strength of $\lambda$. Given this context, which of the following statements best describes how the gradient of the cross-entropy loss function with respect to the model weights $\mathbf{w}$ (for a single training example and a specific class $k$) should be calculated to update the weights using gradient descent?

1. $\nabla_{\mathbf{w}_k} J = -\mathbf{x}(y_k - \hat{y}_k) + 2\lambda\mathbf{w}_k$ where $y_k$ is the true label (1 for the correct class, 0 otherwise), and $\hat{y}_k$ is the predicted probability for class $k$.
2. $\nabla_{\mathbf{w}_k} J = -\mathbf{x}(y_k - \log(\hat{y}_k)) + \lambda\mathbf{w}_k$ since the cross-entropy loss incorporates the logarithm of predicted probabilities.
3. $\nabla_{\mathbf{w}_k} J = -\mathbf{x}(\log(y_k) - \hat{y}_k) + \lambda\|\mathbf{w}_k\|_1$ assuming L1 regularization is used instead of L2.
4. $\nabla_{\mathbf{w}_k} J = -\mathbf{x}(y_k - \hat{y}_k) + \lambda\mathbf{w}_k$ without considering the factor of 2 in the regularization term.
5. $\nabla_{\mathbf{w}_k} J = \mathbf{x}(\hat{y}_k - y_k) + 2\lambda\mathbf{w}_k$ reflecting the correct direction of the gradient for minimizing the loss.

## Solution

To arrive at the correct answer, some fundamental concepts related to logistic regression, especially within a multinomial context, and its optimization process need to be revisited. Multinomial logistic regression extends binary logistic regression to multiple classes and uses the softmax function to model the probability distribution across these classes. The gradient of the loss function is vital for updating the weights via gradient descent. 

Given the use of the cross-entropy loss function for multinomial classification, the objective is to minimize the negative log likelihood of the correct class labels. The cross-entropy loss for a single instance and class $k$ is $-y_k \log(\hat{y}_k)$, where $y_k$ is the true label (encoded as 1 for the correct class and 0 for others) and $\hat{y}_k$ is the predicted probability that the instance belongs to class $k$. 

Regularization, specifically L2 in this scenario, is added to the loss function to control overfitting by penalizing large weights. The L2 regularization term for a weight vector $\mathbf{w}_k$ is $\lambda\|\mathbf{w}_k\|_2^2$, where $\lambda$ is the regularization strength.

The gradient of the cross-entropy loss for a specific weight vector $\mathbf{w}_k$ considering L2 regularization is thus the partial derivative of the loss with respect to $\mathbf{w}_k$, which combines both the error from the prediction (the difference $\hat{y}_k - y_k$) and the regularization term. The correct formulation must account for the negative sign (since weâ€™re considering minimization), include the feature vector $\mathbf{x}$ (because the gradient with respect to $\mathbf{w}_k$ involves $\mathbf{x}$ due to the chain rule), and correctly apply the regularization term.

For the gradient descent update, the correct form is thus $\nabla_{\mathbf{w}_k} J = \mathbf{x}(\hat{y}_k - y_k) + 2\lambda\mathbf{w}_k$. Note that the gradient of the L2 regularization term $\lambda\|\mathbf{w}_k\|_2^2$ with respect to $\mathbf{w}_k$ is $2\lambda\mathbf{w}_k$, not $\lambda\mathbf{w}_k$. Hence, the correct answer is reflected in the choice that correctly includes the impact of the feature vector, the prediction error (with the correct order for subtraction), and the L2 regularization term with the correct factor.

## Correct Answer

5. $\nabla_{\mathbf{w}_k} J = \mathbf{x}(\hat{y}_k - y_k) + 2\lambda\mathbf{w}_k$ reflecting the correct direction of the gradient for minimizing the loss.

## Reasoning

This answer is correct because it accurately combines all critical elements of the optimization problem:

- It recognizes the role of $\mathbf{x}$, the feature vector, in computing the gradient of the loss with respect to the weights, as derived from the chain rule in calculus.
- It correctly states the direction and components of the prediction error $({\hat{y}_k} - y_k)$, aligning with the intuition that to minimize loss, weights should be adjusted in the direction of reducing the difference between predicted and actual values.
- It incorporates the L2 regularization term appropriately, with the correct multiplication by 2, reflecting the derivative of the squared norm $\|\mathbf{w}_k\|_2^2$, thus ensuring the regularization's effect on preventing overfitting by penalizing large weights is properly represented in the gradient calculation.
