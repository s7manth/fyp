## Question
Given a natural language processing task of classifying tweets into three sentiment categories: positive, neutral, and negative, a multinomial logistic regression model is deployed. The model's learning employs a cross-entropy loss function and L2 regularization to mitigate overfitting. Given the softmax function for a single instance $x^{(i)}$ is expressed as $P(y^{(i)} = k|x^{(i)}; \theta) = \frac{\exp(\theta_k^T x^{(i)})}{\sum_{j=1}^K \exp(\theta_j^T x^{(i)})}$ for $K$ classes and the corresponding cross-entropy loss for $N$ instances is $J(\theta) = - \frac{1}{N} \left[ \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{k=1}^K 1\left\{y^{(i)} = k\right\} \log \left( \frac{\exp(\theta_k^T x^{(i)})}{\sum_{j=1}^K \exp(\theta_j^T x^{(i)})} \right) \right] + \frac{\lambda}{2N} \sum_{k=1}^K \|\theta_k\|^2$, where $1\{.\}$ is the indicator function, $\lambda$ is the regularization strength, and $\|\theta_k\|^2$ denotes the L2 norm of the parameter vector for class $k$. The learning updates for the parameters using gradient descent should consider the effect of regularization. What is the correct update rule for $\theta_k$?

1. $\theta_k := \theta_k - \alpha \left( \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \left( P(y^{(i)} = k|x^{(i)}; \theta) - 1\{y^{(i)} = k\} \right) x^{(i)} + \lambda \theta_k \right)$
2. $\theta_k := \theta_k - \alpha \left( \sum_{i=1}^N \left( P(y^{(i)} = k|x^{(i)}; \theta) - 1\{y^{(i)} = k\} \right) x^{(i)} \right)$
3. $\theta_k := \theta_k - \alpha \left( \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \left( P(y^{(i)} = k|x^{(i)}; \theta) \right) x^{(i)} + \lambda \theta_k \right)$
4. $\theta_k := \theta_k + \alpha \left( \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \left( P(y^{(i)} = k|x^{(i)}; \theta) - 1\{y^{(i)} = k\} \right) x^{(i)} - \lambda \theta_k \right)$
5. $\theta_k := \theta_k - \alpha \left( \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \left( P(y^{(i)} = k|x^{(i)}; \theta) - 1\{y^{(i)} = k\} \right) x^{(i)} \right)$

## Solution

The correct update rule for the parameters of multinomial logistic regression, considering the cross-entropy loss with L2 regularization and the gradient descent method, comes from deriving the gradient of the loss function with respect to $\theta_k$. 

Firstly, the gradient of the cross-entropy term without the regularization part is $\frac{\partial J(\theta)}{\partial \theta_k} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \left( P(y^{(i)} = k|x^{(i)}; \theta) - 1\{y^{(i)} = k\} \right) x^{(i)}$. This represents the difference between the predicted probabilities and the actual outcomes, averaged over all instances.

Secondly, considering the regularization term's gradient, which applies only to the parameters and is derived as $\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta_k} \left( \frac{\lambda}{2N} \sum_{k=1}^K \|\theta_k\|^2 \right) = \frac{\lambda}{N} \theta_k$ as the derivative of $\|\theta_k\|^2$ with respect to $\theta_k$ is $2\theta_k$, and including the $\frac{1}{2}$ from the loss function cancels a $2$ out.

Combining both, the gradient of the loss function considering regularization is:

$$\frac{\partial J(\theta)}{\partial \theta_k} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \left( P(y^{(i)} = k|x^{(i)}; \theta) - 1\{y^{(i)} = k\} \right) x^{(i)} + \frac{\lambda}{N} \theta_k$$

The update rule using gradient descent is formulated as subtracting the gradient from the current parameter values, scaled by the learning rate $\alpha$. Hence, the correct update rule is:

$$\theta_k := \theta_k - \alpha \left( \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \left( P(y^{(i)} = k|x^{(i)}; \theta) - 1\{y^{(i)} = k\} \right) x^{(i)} + \lambda \theta_k \right)$$

## Correct Answer

1. $\theta_k := \theta_k - \alpha \left( \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \left( P(y^{(i)} = k|x^{(i)}; \theta) - 1\{y^{(i)} = k\} \right) x^{(i)} + \lambda \theta_k \right)$

## Reasoning

This update rule correctly incorporates the impact of both the prediction error (the difference between predicted probabilities and actual class indicators) and the regularization term. The goal of L2 regularization is to penalize large weights to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty proportional to the square of the magnitude of the coefficients, which explains the presence of $\lambda \theta_k$ in the update rule. The inclusion of the regularization term with the gradient of the cross-entropy loss ensures that the model parameters are updated in a way that not only minimizes the prediction error over the training set but also keeps the model complexity in check, balancing between the model's fit to the training data and its generalization to new, unseen data.
