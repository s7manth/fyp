## Question

Given a binary classification task to distinguish between positive and negative sentiment in movie reviews, you decide to use logistic regression for this task. You have a dataset D consisting of movie reviews $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), ..., (x_n, y_n)$ where $x_i$ represents the feature vector of the ith review, and $y_i \in \{0, 1\}$ is the label indicating negative (0) or positive (1) sentiment. You decide to use the cross-entropy loss to train your model, incorporate L2 regularization to prevent overfitting, and apply gradient descent for optimization.

Given the logistic regression model defined by the probability $P(y = 1 | x; \theta) = \sigma(\theta^T x)$ where $\sigma(z) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}$ is the sigmoid function and $\theta$ represents the model parameters, which of the following expressions correctly represents the gradient of the regularized cross-entropy loss with respect to the model parameters $\theta$ for the dataset D?   
Assume the regularization parameter is $\lambda$.

1. $\nabla_\theta L(\theta) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (\sigma(\theta^T x_i) - y_i) x_i + \frac{2\lambda}{n} \theta$
2. $\nabla_\theta L(\theta) = -\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (\sigma(\theta^T x_i) - y_i) x_i + \lambda \theta$
3. $\nabla_\theta L(\theta) = -\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (\sigma(\theta^T x_i) - y_i) x_i - 2\lambda \theta$
4. $\nabla_\theta L(\theta) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (\sigma(\theta^T x_i) - y_i) x_i + \lambda \theta$
5. $\nabla_\theta L(\theta) = -\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (\sigma(\theta^T x_i) - y_i) x_i + \frac{2\lambda}{n} \theta$

## Solution

The correct answer is 1. $\nabla_\theta L(\theta) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (\sigma(\theta^T x_i) - y_i) x_i + \frac{2\lambda}{n} \theta$

To derive the gradient of the regularized cross-entropy loss with respect to $\theta$, we start by writing the cross-entropy loss function for our dataset D:

$$L(\theta) = -\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n [y_i \log(\sigma(\theta^T x_i)) + (1-y_i)\log(1-\sigma(\theta^T x_i))] + \frac{\lambda}{n} ||\theta||^2_2$$

The regularization term is written as $\frac{\lambda}{n} ||\theta||^2_2$ where $||\theta||^2_2$ represents the L2 norm of $\theta$.

Taking the gradient of $L(\theta)$ with respect to $\theta$, we separate the derivation into two parts: the derivative of the cross-entropy part and the derivative of the regularization part.

For the cross-entropy part, using the chain rule, the derivative of the loss with respect to $\theta_j$ can be obtained as:

$$\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta_j} L(\theta) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (\sigma(\theta^T x_i) - y_i) x_{ij}$$

For the regularization part, the derivative of the L2 norm $||\theta||^2_2$ with respect to $\theta_j$ is $2\theta_j$. Thus, the derivative of the regularization term with respect to $\theta_j$ is:

$$\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta_j} \left(\frac{\lambda}{n}||\theta||^2_2\right) = \frac{2\lambda}{n} \theta_j$$

Combining these, the gradient of the regularized cross-entropy loss with respect to the parameters $\theta$ is:

$$\nabla_\theta L(\theta) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (\sigma(\theta^T x_i) - y_i) x_i + \frac{2\lambda}{n} \theta$$

This matches option 1.

## Correct Answer

1. $\nabla_\theta L(\theta) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (\sigma(\theta^T x_i) - y_i) x_i + \frac{2\lambda}{n} \theta$

## Reasoning

The gradient derivation involves two main components: the gradient of the cross-entropy loss part, and the gradient of the regularization part. For the cross-entropy loss, it is essential to apply the chain rule on the log-likelihood, resulting in the difference between predicted probabilities and actual class labels weighted by the input features. The regularization part's derivation, focusing on L2 regularization, involves taking the derivative of the squared norm of the parameter vector, resulting in a direct proportionality with the parameters themselves. Adding these two parts together gives the gradient of the regularized cross-entropy loss, which is crucial for updating the parameters during gradient descent optimization. Option 1 correctly combines these elements and includes the appropriate scaling by the number of samples $n$ and regularization term $\lambda$.
