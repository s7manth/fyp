## Question
Consider a multinomial logistic regression task where you are predicting the sentiment of sentences from a product review dataset. The sentiments are categorized into "positive", "neutral", and "negative". During the training process, you decide to implement L2 regularization to prevent overfitting. The regularization parameter is denoted by $\lambda$. 

Your dataset is not linearly separable, prompting the model to learn complex boundaries. You notice that while training, the loss initially decreases but eventually starts to increase, and the model's performance on the validation dataset degrades over epochs. You suspect that the choice of $\lambda$ could be the cause.

Based on this information, which of the following actions regarding the regularization parameter $\lambda$ could potentially address the issue of the increasing loss and the degradation of validation performance?

1. Increase $\lambda$ significantly to enforce a stronger regularization effect.
2. Decrease $\lambda$ slightly to allow the model to learn more complex boundaries without overfitting significantly.
3. Keep $\lambda$ constant but reduce the learning rate of the gradient descent optimizer.
4. Set $\lambda$ to zero, effectively removing L2 regularization from the training process.
5. Perform a grid search over a range of $\lambda$ values to find the optimal setting that minimizes validation loss.

## Solution

The first thing to understand is the role of the regularization parameter $\lambda$ in L2 regularization. L2 regularization adds a penalty to the loss function proportional to the square of the magnitude of the model coefficients. The purpose is to prevent the coefficients from becoming too large, which can lead to overfitting on the training data. The regularization parameter $\lambda$ controls the strength of this penalty. A larger $\lambda$ results in a stronger regularization effect, and a smaller $\lambda$ results in a weaker effect.

Given that the loss initially decreases but then starts to increase, along with a degradation in validation performance, it suggests that the model might initially be learning well but then starts to overfit the training data. Overfitting is characterized by a model performing well on training data but poorly on unseen data (such as the validation dataset).

1. **Increase $\lambda$ significantly**: This will enforce stronger regularization, which might prevent overfitting by simplifying model boundaries. However, if the model is already underperforming due to being too simple, this could exacerbate the problem.
2. **Decrease $\lambda$ slightly**: This allows the model to learn more complex boundaries. If the model was over-regularized, reducing $\lambda$ could improve its ability to capture the underlying patterns in the data without significantly increasing the risk of overfitting.
3. **Keep $\lambda$ constant but reduce the learning rate**: Reducing the learning rate might help with convergence issues but does not directly address overfitting or underfitting problems related to the strength of regularization.
4. **Set $\lambda$ to zero**: This would remove regularization entirely, which could lead to overfitting, especially in a complex model or when the data is not linearly separable.
5. **Perform a grid search over a range of $\lambda$ values**: This is a systematic way to find the optimal $\lambda$ that balances model complexity and generalization ability, potentially addressing the issue of increasing loss and degraded validation performance by finding the right level of regularization.

Considering the scenario and the described problem, **option 5** would be the most comprehensive and systematic approach to addressing the issue of model performance degradation due to potential misconfiguration of the regularization parameter.

## Correct Answer
5. Perform a grid search over a range of $\lambda$ values to find the optimal setting that minimizes validation loss.

## Reasoning
Performing a grid search over a range of $\lambda$ values allows for an exhaustive exploration of the effect of regularization strength on model performance. It directly addresses the concern that the current setting of $\lambda$ might be suboptimal by either being too high (leading to underfitting) or too low (leading to overfitting). By optimizing for the best $\lambda$ that minimizes validation loss, we are effectively balancing the trade-off between bias and variance, thereby improving the model's generalization ability on unseen data. This methodical approach aligns well with best practices in model tuning and is most likely to address the problem described.
