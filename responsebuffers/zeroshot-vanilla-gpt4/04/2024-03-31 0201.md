## Question
Consider a dataset for a multinomial logistic regression problem where the feature vector $x \in \mathbb{R}^d$ and the target variable $y \in \{1, 2, 3\}$. The algorithm uses the softmax function for the hypothesis and cross-entropy loss as the cost function. Regularization is applied to prevent overfitting, with $\lambda$ being the regularization parameter. Given the cost function for a single training example $(x, y)$ as:

$$J(\theta) = - \sum_{k=1}^{3}I(y = k)\log\left(\frac{e^{\theta_k^Tx}}{\sum_{j=1}^{3} e^{\theta_j^Tx}}\right) + \frac{\lambda}{2}\sum_{k=1}^{3}\|\theta_k\|^2$$

where $\theta_k$ is the parameter vector corresponding to class $k$, and $I(y = k)$ is the indicator function, which is 1 if $y = k$ and 0 otherwise.

Which of the following statements best describes the gradient of $J(\theta)$ with respect to $\theta_k$ needed for updating the parameters using gradient descent?

1. \(\nabla_{\theta_k} J(\theta) = (h_\theta(x) - I(y = k))x + \lambda \theta_k\), where \(h_\theta(x)\) is the predicted probability that \(y = k\) given \(x\).
2. \(\nabla_{\theta_k} J(\theta) = \sum_{i=1}^{m}(h_\theta(x^{(i)}) - I(y^{(i)} = k))x^{(i)}\), ignoring the regularization term for simplicity.
3. \(\nabla_{\theta_k} J(\theta) = (h_\theta(x) - I(y = k))x - \lambda \|\theta_k\|\), applying L2 regularization.
4. \(\nabla_{\theta_k} J(\theta) = (I(y = k) - h_\theta(x))x + \lambda \theta_k\), where \(h_\theta(x)\) is the predicted probability for all classes given \(x\).
5. \(\nabla_{\theta_k} J(\theta) = \sum_{i=1}^{m}(h_\theta(x^{(i)}) - I(y^{(i)} = k))x^{(i)} + \lambda \theta_k\), where \(m\) is the number of training examples, considering both the effect of the example and regularization.

## Solution

The gradient of the cost function $J(\theta)$ with respect to $\theta_k$ is crucial for updating the parameters of the model during the training process. The correct computation of this gradient must take into account both the error in the predictions and the regularization term.

Firstly, we note that the derivative of the cost function with respect to $\theta_k$ for a given class $k$ involves computing the difference between the predicted probability that $y = k$ given $x$, denoted as $h_\theta(x)$, and the indicator function $I(y = k)$. This forms the basis of the gradient that captures how the cost changes with $\theta_k$. Furthermore, in applying regularization, specifically L2 regularization, the derivative of the regularization term with respect to $\theta_k$ must be added, which amounts to $\lambda \theta_k$.

Regarding the gradient of the cost function for logistic regression with regularization, the correct expression incorporates the result from each individual training example and the regularization term. Hence, the complete gradient of $J(\theta)$ with respect to $\theta_k$, considering all training examples ($m$ in number) and regularization, is given by:

$$\nabla_{\theta_k} J(\theta) = \sum_{i=1}^{m}(h_\theta(x^{(i)}) - I(y^{(i)} = k))x^{(i)} + \lambda \theta_k$$

This formula accurately represents the gradient needed for parameter update in each step of gradient descent, taking into account the contribution from the error in predictions and the effect of regularization to penalize large values of $\theta_k$.

## Correct Answer

5. \(\nabla_{\theta_k} J(\theta) = \sum_{i=1}^{m}(h_\theta(x^{(i)}) - I(y^{(i)} = k))x^{(i)} + \lambda \theta_k\), where \(m\) is the number of training examples, considering both the effect of the example and regularization.

## Reasoning

The correct choice directly follows from understanding the components of the cost function in multinomial logistic regression and the implications of regularization. The softmax function used for the hypothesis predicts probabilities of each class for a given input vector $x$. The cross-entropy loss compares these predicted probabilities against the actual class (using the indicator function) to measure the prediction error. When calculating gradients for parameter updates, we need to aggregate this error across all training examples ($m$) and adjust for overfitting using regularization, specifically L2 regularization, which is added as $\lambda \theta_k$ for each parameter vector $\theta_k$. This leads us to choice 5, which correctly addresses both the error minimization and regularization in the gradient computation formula, thus facilitating appropriate parameter updating in the learning process.
