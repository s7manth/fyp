## Question
In the context of natural language processing (NLP), consider a sentiment analysis task where you're classifying text into three sentiment categories: positive, neutral, and negative. You decide to use multinomial logistic regression for this multi-class classification problem. You implement a model and use softmax as the activation function for the output layer to handle the multiple classes. 

Now, to train this model effectively, you opt for the cross-entropy loss function and plan to use gradient descent for optimization. Given the complexity of the data and model, you also decide to implement L2 regularization to prevent overfitting. Suppose your regularization strength is $\lambda$, the cross-entropy loss for a single example is $L$, and the weights of your model are represented by $W$.

Which of the following represents the regularized loss function $J$ that you should minimize using gradient descent?

1. $J = L + \frac{\lambda}{2m} \sum_{j=1}^n W_j^2$
2. $J = L + \frac{\lambda}{2} \sum_{j=1}^n W_j^2$
3. $J = L - \frac{\lambda}{2m} \sum_{j=1}^n W_j^2$
4. $J = L + \lambda \sum_{j=1}^n |W_j|$
5. $J = L + \frac{1}{2m}\sum_{j=1}^n W_j^2$

## Solution
To find the correct formula for the regularized loss function $J$, one should understand how regularization works alongside the loss function in a machine learning context. Regularization aims to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty on larger weights to the loss function. The L2 regularization, in particular, adds a penalty term that is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the coefficients.

The original cross-entropy loss function for a classification problem is represented by $L$. To integrate L2 regularization (also known as Ridge regularization), we add a term $\frac{\lambda}{2} times$ the sum of the squares of the weights, where $\lambda$ is the regularization strength. However, it's also common to normalize this term by the number of samples $m$ to keep the regularization term scale invariant to the size of the training set, making the choice 1 the correct formula. Therefore, the regularized loss function $J$ incorporating L2 regularization is correctly represented by:

$$J = L + \frac{\lambda}{2m} \sum_{j=1}^n W_j^2$$

This formula adds a penalty to the loss function $L$, which discourages large weights by adding the square of the magnitude of the weights multiplied by the regularization strength $\lambda$ divided by twice the number of samples $m$.

## Correct Answer
1. $J = L + \frac{\lambda}{2m} \sum_{j=1}^n W_j^2$

## Reasoning
The correct formula combines the original loss function with the regularization term correctly for the following reasons:
- It uses L2 regularization, evident from the square of weights term $\sum_{j=1}^n W_j^2$.
- It applies $\frac{\lambda}{2m}$ as the coefficient of the regularization term, which correctly accounts for the regularization strength and averages the penalty across all samples to avoid scaling issues with the loss due to the dataset size, making it more stable and generalizable.
- Other options are incorrect as they either miss representing L2 regularization properly (Choices 3, 4, and 5) or do not correctly adjust for the number of samples in the dataset (Choice 2), which is critical for maintaining consistency of the regularization effect regardless of the size of the data set.
