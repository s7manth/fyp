## Question
Given a multinomial logistic regression model used to classify text data into one of three categories: Technology, Sports, and Arts. The model uses a one-vs-rest (OvR) scheme for training. Each category's likelihood is calculated using a linear combination of features followed by a softmax function for normalization. Suppose the feature vector for a particular text document is $\mathbf{x} = [1, 2, 3]^T$, and the weight vectors for Technology, Sports, and Arts categories are $\mathbf{w}_{tech} = [0.2, 0.1, 0.4]^T$, $\mathbf{w}_{sports} = [0.1, 0.3, 0.1]^T$, and $\mathbf{w}_{arts} = [0.3, 0.2, 0.2]^T$, respectively. The bias terms for all categories are assumed to be zero for simplification.

Which of the following correctly calculates the probability that the document belongs to the Technology category?

1. $\frac{e^{0.2 + 0.2 + 0.8}}{e^{0.2 + 0.2 + 0.8} + e^{0.1 + 0.6 + 0.3} + e^{0.3 + 0.4 + 0.6}}$
2. $\frac{e^{0.2 \cdot 1 + 0.1 \cdot 2 + 0.4 \cdot 3}}{e^{0.2 \cdot 1 + 0.1 \cdot 2 + 0.4 \cdot 3} + e^{0.1 \cdot 1 + 0.3 \cdot 2 + 0.1 \cdot 3} + e^{0.3 \cdot 1 + 0.2 \cdot 2 + 0.2 \cdot 3}}$
3. $\frac{1}{1 + e^{- (0.2 \cdot 1 + 0.1 \cdot 2 + 0.4 \cdot 3)}}$
4. $\frac{e^{0.2 \cdot 1 + 0.1 \cdot 2 + 0.4 \cdot 3}}{1 + e^{0.2 \cdot 1 + 0.1 \cdot 2 + 0.4 \cdot 3}}$
5. $\frac{1}{3}$

## Solution

To calculate the probability that the document belongs to the Technology category using a multinomial logistic regression model, we first compute the linear combination of the features with the respective weight vector for the Technology category. Then, we apply the softmax function for normalization across all categories.

The linear combination for the Technology category is given by $\mathbf{w}_{tech}^T \mathbf{x} = 0.2 \cdot 1 + 0.1 \cdot 2 + 0.4 \cdot 3 = 0.2 + 0.2 + 1.2 = 1.6$.

Similarly, for the Sports category, it's $\mathbf{w}_{sports}^T \mathbf{x} = 0.1 \cdot 1 + 0.3 \cdot 2 + 0.1 \cdot 3 = 0.1 + 0.6 + 0.3 = 1.0$.

And for the Arts category, it's $\mathbf{w}_{arts}^T \mathbf{x} = 0.3 \cdot 1 + 0.2 \cdot 2 + 0.2 \cdot 3 = 0.3 + 0.4 + 0.6 = 1.3$.

Using these linear combinations in the softmax function for the Technology category, we get:

$$
P(\text{Technology} | \mathbf{x}) = \frac{e^{1.6}}{e^{1.6} + e^{1.0} + e^{1.3}}.
$$

Plugging in the calculated values, we get:

$$
P(\text{Technology} | \mathbf{x}) = \frac{e^{1.6}}{e^{1.6} + e^{1.0} + e^{1.3}} = \frac{e^{1.6}}{e^{1.6} + e^{1.0} + e^{1.3}}.
$$

This matches the formulation given in choice 2:

$$
\frac{e^{0.2 \cdot 1 + 0.1 \cdot 2 + 0.4 \cdot 3}}{e^{0.2 \cdot 1 + 0.1 \cdot 2 + 0.4 \cdot 3} + e^{0.1 \cdot 1 + 0.3 \cdot 2 + 0.1 \cdot 3} + e^{0.3 \cdot 1 + 0.2 \cdot 2 + 0.2 \cdot 3}}.
$$

## Correct Answer
2. $\frac{e^{0.2 \cdot 1 + 0.1 \cdot 2 + 0.4 \cdot 3}}{e^{0.2 \cdot 1 + 0.1 \cdot 2 + 0.4 \cdot 3} + e^{0.1 \cdot 1 + 0.3 \cdot 2 + 0.1 \cdot 3} + e^{0.3 \cdot 1 + 0.2 \cdot 2 + 0.2 \cdot 3}}$

## Reasoning
In multinomial logistic regression, the probability that a sample belongs to a particular class is computed by normalizing the exponential of the linear combination of its features (weighted sum) for that class against the sum of exponentials of the linear combinations for all classes. The softmax function is used for this normalization. The provided calculations accurately reflect the steps for computing the probability that the given document belongs to the Technology category using the weights for the feature vector provided, thus making choice 2 the correct answer.
