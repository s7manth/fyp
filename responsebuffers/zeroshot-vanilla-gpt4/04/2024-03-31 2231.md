## Question

Given a dataset with three classes (Class 1, Class 2, Class 3), a machine learning engineer needs to build a classifier using multinomial logistic regression. The dataset features are $x_1, x_2,$ and $x_3$. The cost function used for this multinomial logistic regression is the cross-entropy loss. To optimize the coefficients of the model, the engineer decides to employ L2 regularization to prevent overfitting. This addition modifies the original cost function. Assuming the regularization strength is denoted by $\lambda$, which of the following represents the new cost function $J$ (where $m$ is the number of samples, $i$ indexes the samples, $y_i$ is the vector of true class probabilities for sample $i$, $h_{\theta}(x_i)$ is the hypothesis function representing the predicted class probabilities, and $\theta_j$ represents the model coefficients excluding the bias)?

1. $J(\theta) = -\frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} \sum_{k=1}^{3} y_{ik} \log(h_{\theta}(x_{i})_k) + \frac{\lambda}{2m} \sum_{j=1}^{3} \theta_j^2$
2. $J(\theta) = -\frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} \sum_{k=1}^{3} y_{ik} \log(h_{\theta}(x_{i})_k) + \frac{\lambda}{2m} \sum_{j=1}^{n} \theta_j^2$
3. $J(\theta) = -\frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} \sum_{k=1}^{3} y_{ik} \log(h_{\theta}(x_{i})_k) + \frac{\lambda}{m} \sum_{j=1}^{3} \theta_j^2$
4. $J(\theta) = -\frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} \sum_{k=1}^{3} y_{ik} \log(h_{\theta}(x_{i})_k) + \lambda \sum_{j=1}^{3} \theta_j^2$
5. $J(\theta) = -\frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} y_i \log(h_{\theta}(x_{i})) + \frac{\lambda}{2m} \sum_{j=1}^{n} \theta_j^2$

## Solution

The correct answer must encapsulate the cross-entropy loss for multinomial logistic regression and take into account the L2 regularization term correctly.

- The cross-entropy loss component for multinomial logistic regression is given by: 
$$-\frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} \sum_{k=1}^{K} y_{ik} \log(h_{\theta}(x_{i})_k)$$
Here, $K$ is the number of classes, which in this scenario, is 3.

- The L2 regularization term is generally represented by:
$$\frac{\lambda}{2m} \sum_{j} \theta_j^2$$
Importantly, this sum does not include the bias term, and the index $j$ should run over all model coefficients for each feature across all classes.

Given this, the correct formulation of the cost function, including both the multinomial logistic regression cross-entropy loss term and the L2 regularization term, must consider that $n$ represents the number of features and $\theta_j$ spans all features for all classes (not just the three classes separately). Therefore: 

Option 2 encapsulates this the best with its expression:
$$J(\theta) = -\frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} \sum_{k=1}^{3} y_{ik} \log(h_{\theta}(x_{i})_k) + \frac{\lambda}{2m} \sum_{j=1}^{n} \theta_j^2$$
This option correctly aggregates the cross-entropy loss across all samples and class probabilities while adding the L2 regularization term that considers all feature coefficients $\theta_j$, appropriately scaled by the number of samples $m$ and regularization strength $\lambda$.

## Correct Answer

2. $J(\theta) = -\frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} \sum_{k=1}^{3} y_{ik} \log(h_{\theta}(x_{i})_k) + \frac{\lambda}{2m} \sum_{j=1}^{n} \theta_j^2$

## Reasoning

The rationale behind the correct choice involves understanding both parts of the modified cost function:

1. **Cross-Entropy Loss in Multinomial Logistic Regression:** Represents the model's performance in accurately predicting the class probabilities. It sums the logarithm of predicted probabilities (from the hypothesis function $h_{\theta}(x_i)$) weighted by the actual class probabilities $y_{ik}$ across all classes and samples.

2. **L2 Regularization:** Penalizes large coefficients to combat overfitting, ensuring the model generalizes well to unseen data. This term adds to the cost function a penalty proportional to the square of the magnitude of the coefficients, scaled by the regularization strength $\lambda$. Importantly, this sum should consider all features across all classes (hence, using $n$ for features rather than limiting to the number of classes $K$ or misinterpreting the component to only sum across classes), and it is averaged over all samples $m$.

This tailored combination allows the cost function to optimize model parameters effectively under the regularization constraint, making option 2 the correct and most comprehensive representation of the cost function for multinomial logistic regression with L2 regularization.
