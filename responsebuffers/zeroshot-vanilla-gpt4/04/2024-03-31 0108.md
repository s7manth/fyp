## Question
While analyzing sentiment analysis results using logistic regression to differentiate between positive and negative movie reviews, you discover that your model performs exceptionally well on the training data but poorly on the validation data. Suspecting overfitting, you decide to employ regularization strategies. You choose L2 regularization to update your logistic regression model to mitigate the overfitting issue. When updating the gradient descent formula for logistic regression with L2 regularization, which of the following expressions represents the correct gradient update for the weight parameters (excluding the bias term) of your model?
1. $\theta_j := \theta_j - \alpha \left( \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} (h_\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})x_j^{(i)} + \lambda \theta_j \right)$
2. $\theta_j := \theta_j - \alpha \left( \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} (h_\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})x_j^{(i)} - \lambda \theta_j^2 \right)$
3. $\theta_j := \theta_j - \alpha \left( \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} (h_\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})x_j^{(i)} \right) - \lambda \alpha \theta_j$
4. $\theta_j := \theta_j + \alpha \left( \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} (h_\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})x_j^{(i)} + \lambda \theta_j \right)$
5. $\theta_j := \theta_j - \alpha \left( \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} (h_\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})x_j^{(i)} \right)$

## Solution
To integrate L2 regularization into the gradient descent update rule for logistic regression, we need to add a term that penalizes larger weights, thereby potentially reducing overfitting. The regularization term for L2 regularization is $\lambda \theta_j^2$, where $\lambda$ is the regularization parameter. However, in the gradient descent update equation, we use the derivative of the regularization term, which is $2\lambda \theta_j$. Since we are considering the weight update (excluding the bias term), the correct gradient descent update formula with L2 regularization becomes:

$$\theta_j := \theta_j - \alpha \left( \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} (h_\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})x_j^{(i)} + \lambda \theta_j \right)$$

However, we typically write the regularization term as $\lambda \theta_j$ directly in the gradient update rule since the $2$ from the derivative (from $\theta_j^2$ becoming $2\theta_j$) is often absorbed into the $\lambda$ term for simplicity. Thus, the penalty term added to the weights is $\lambda \theta_j$, not $2\lambda \theta_j$ or $\lambda \theta_j^2$, and it is subtracted during the update, which effectively decreases the magnitude of the weight parameters to prevent overfitting.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
1. $\theta_j := \theta_j - \alpha \left( \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} (h_\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})x_j^{(i)} + \lambda \theta_j \right)$

## Correct Answer
1. $\theta_j := \theta_j - \alpha \left( \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} (h_\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})x_j^{(i)} + \lambda \theta_j \right)$

## Reasoning
The correct gradient update rule with L2 regularization adds a term $\lambda \theta_j$ to the standard gradient descent formula for logistic regression. This term acts to penalize larger weights by reducing their size with each iteration, effectively adding a control mechanism against overfitting to more complex models. The addition of this regularization term helps to ensure that the model does not overly adjust to the training data, thereby improving its generalization performance on unseen data. Other provided options incorrectly represent the L2 regularization term or its incorporation into the gradient descent formula.
