## Question

In a natural language processing application to predict the sentiment (positive, neutral, negative) of movie reviews using multinomial logistic regression, the model's predictions over a validation dataset consistently return higher probabilities for the "neutral" class, regardless of the actual sentiment. Given the model uses the softmax function for the probability assignments and the cross-entropy loss for optimization during training, which of the following adjustments is least likely to address the bias towards predicting the "neutral" sentiment?

1. Increasing the size of the training dataset with more representative samples for the "positive" and "negative" classes.
2. Applying L2 regularization to reduce overfitting on the "neutral" sentiment features.
3. Tweaking the learning rate and employing early stopping during training to prevent overfitting.
4. Adjusting class weights to penalize misclassifications of the "positive" and "negative" classes more heavily.
5. Redefining the problem as a binary classification by merging the "positive" and "negative" classes into a single "non-neutral" class.

## Solution

To find the least likely adjustment to address the model's bias:


- **Increasing the size of the training dataset with more representative samples for the "positive" and "negative" classes** would help the model learn these sentiments better, thus potentially decreasing bias towards "neutral".


- **Applying L2 regularization reduces the model's complexity, addressing overfitting** but it might not directly impact the bias towards predicting the "neutral" sentiment unless the bias is specifically due to overfitting on features specific to the "neutral" class.


- **Tweaking the learning rate and employing early stopping is primarily aimed at preventing overfitting** by stopping the training before the model’s performance starts degrading on the validation dataset. Like L2 regularization, this strategy might not directly address the bias towards the "neutral" sentiment.


- **Adjusting class weights to penalize misclassifications of the "positive" and "negative" classes more heavily** directly aims at making the model more sensitive towards these classes. This strategy is specifically targeted at addressing imbalances or biases towards a particular class, making it a very relevant option.


- **Redefining the problem as a binary classification by merging the "positive" and "negative" classes into a single "non-neutral" class** changes the fundamental structure of the task. This adjustment might simplify the classification problem and potentially improve performance for distinguishing between neutral and non-neutral sentiments. However, it does not directly address the model’s current bias towards "neutral" in the context of a three-class classification problem. It instead sidesteps the issue by changing the task.


## Correct Answer

5. Redefining the problem as a binary classification by merging the "positive" and "negative" classes into a single "non-neutral" class.

## Reasoning

Each proposed adjustment, except for the fifth option, works within the framework of the existing multinomial logistic regression model and addresses potential reasons for the model's bias towards the "neutral" sentiment by either improving the representation of "positive" and "negative" classes, applying regularization to handle overfitting, or directly penalizing misclassifications of underrepresented classes. 

Option 5, while potentially a valid strategic decision in some contexts, does not target the bias issue within the tri-class framework. Instead, it proposes a fundamental change to the problem definition, which might increase overall accuracy but does not solve the original issue of the "neutral" bias in a multinomial setting. Therefore, it is the least likely adjustment to directly address the described problem.
