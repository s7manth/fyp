## Question
Given a logistic regression model aimed at classifying news articles into three categories: politics, technology, and sports, the model uses a softmax function for the multinomial classification and is trained using cross-entropy loss. During training, an L2 regularization term is added to the loss function to prevent overfitting, with a regularization coefficient $\lambda = 0.01$. The feature vector for each article is represented by $\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^d$, and the weight matrix for the classes is $\mathbf{W} \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times 3}$. Assume the bias has been incorporated into $\mathbf{W}$ and $\mathbf{x}$.

After training, the model processes a new article feature vector $\mathbf{x}_{new}$, resulting in raw scores (logits) $\mathbf{z} = \mathbf{W}^T\mathbf{x}_{new}$. These logits are then passed through the softmax function to get the probabilities of each class. Given this setup, which of the following statements is **CORRECT** about the impact of the L2 regularization on the training and the interpretation of the model's predictions?

1. L2 regularization primarily reduces the variance among the predictions for all classes, leading to a high certainty in prediction, which can significantly reduce the model's ability to generalize to new unseen data.
2. The addition of the L2 regularization term increases the likelihood of the model underfitting the training data, as it constrains the magnitude of the weights, potentially leading to simpler decision boundaries than necessary.
3. L2 regularization ensures that the softmax probabilities for each class are equally distributed, thereby preventing the model from favoring any particular class.
4. The primary effect of L2 regularization is to penalize large weights in the model, encouraging weights to be small unless having large weights substantially decreases the original cross-entropy loss, thereby helping in reducing overfitting.
5. L2 regularization directly affects the computation of the softmax probabilities by altering the logits, $\mathbf{z}$, to be inversely proportional to the regularization coefficient $\lambda$.

## Solution

The correct choice is:

4. The primary effect of L2 regularization is to penalize large weights in the model, encouraging weights to be small unless having large weights substantially decreases the original cross-entropy loss, thereby helping in reducing overfitting.

### Correct Answer

4. The primary effect of L2 regularization is to penalize large weights in the model, encouraging weights to be small unless having large weights substantially decreases the original cross-entropy loss, thereby helping in reducing overfitting.

### Reasoning

In the context of logistic and multinomial logistic regression, regularization terms are added to the loss function during training to control the complexity of the model and help prevent overfitting, especially in situations where there are many features or when the dataset is small. The L2 regularization specifically adds a penalty term equal to the square of the magnitude of the coefficients (weights). Mathematically, for L2 regularization, the loss function during training includes an additional term, $\lambda \|\mathbf{W}\|^2$, where $\lambda$ is the regularization coefficient, and $\|\mathbf{W}\|^2$ represents the squared Frobenius norm of the weights $\mathbf{W}$.

1. **Incorrect:** L2 regularization does not directly influence the variance among predictions for each class. Its primary role is in controlling the magnitude of the weights to prevent overfitting, not in homogenizing the certainty across class predictions.
   
2. **Incorrect:** While it is true that excessive regularization can lead to underfitting by overly simplifying the model, the statement is too absolute in suggesting it primarily increases the likelihood of underfitting. The balance between underfitting and overfitting is nuanced and depends on the regularization coefficient's value.
   
3. **Incorrect:** L2 regularization does not directly ensure equal distribution of softmax probabilities. The softmax function calculates the probabilities based on the raw scores (logits) and is not directly modified by L2 regularization.
   
4. **Correct:** This statement accurately captures the essence of L2 regularization. By adding a penalty term proportional to the square of the weights, L2 regularization discourages large weights unless they are justified by a significant reduction in the original loss (cross-entropy in this case), thereby helping control overfitting.

5. **Incorrect:** L2 regularization does not alter the computation of logits or the softmax probabilities directly. The regularization affects the training process by influencing the weight values, but it does not modify how the logits are computed or how they are transformed into probabilities.
