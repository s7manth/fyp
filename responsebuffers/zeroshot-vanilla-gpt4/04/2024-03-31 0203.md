## Question
Consider a natural language processing system designed to categorize email messages into three categories: "Business", "Personal", and "Spam". Assume that you are implementing a multinomial logistic regression model for this multi-class classification task.

Given a feature vector $x$ representing an email, and assuming the model parameters for the classes "Business", "Personal", and "Spam" are denoted by $\theta_{business}$, $\theta_{personal}$, and $\theta_{spam}$ respectively, which of the following expressions correctly calculates the probability that an email $x$ belongs to the "Business" category?

1. $P(\text{"Business"} | x) = \frac{e^{\theta_{business}^T x}}{e^{\theta_{business}^T x} + e^{\theta_{personal}^T x} + e^{\theta_{spam}^T x}}$
2. $P(\text{"Business"} | x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\theta_{business}^T x)}}$
3. $P(\text{"Business"} | x) = \frac{e^{\theta_{business}^T x}}{1 + e^{\theta_{business}^T x} + e^{\theta_{personal}^T x}}$
4. $P(\text{"Business"} | x) = \frac{e^{\theta_{personal}^T x}}{e^{\theta_{business}^T x} + e^{\theta_{personal}^T x} + e^{\theta_{spam}^T x}}$
5. $P(\text{"Business"} | x) = e^{\theta_{business}^T x} - e^{\theta_{personal}^T x} - e^{\theta_{spam}^T x}$

## Solution
To solve this question, we need an understanding of multinomial logistic regression, which generalizes logistic regression to multi-class problems.

In multinomial logistic regression, the probability that a given sample $x$ belongs to a class $k$ out of $K$ total classes is given by the softmax function:

$$P(y=k|x) = \frac{e^{\theta_k^T x}}{\sum_{j=1}^{K} e^{\theta_j^T x}}$$

where $\theta_k$ is the parameter vector associated with class $k$, and the denominator sums the exponentiated parameter vector dot product with $x$ for all classes.

Given this, we can determine the correct answer:

1. Expression 1 is the correct formula for calculating the probability that an email $x$ belongs to the "Business" category using multinomial logistic regression. Here, $\theta_{business}$, $\theta_{personal}$, and $\theta_{spam}$ are the parameter vectors for the "Business", "Personal", and "Spam" categories, respectively. This formula aligns with the softmax function structure, calculating the exponentiated dot product of the feature vector $x$ and the parameter vector for "Business" divided by the sum of exponentiated dot products for all categories.

2. Expression 2 models a binary classification problem using binary logistic regression, inappropriate for a three-class problem.

3. Expression 3 is incorrect because it omits the exponentiated dot product term for the "Spam" category in the denominator, misrepresenting the softmax calculation necessary for multinomial classification.

4. Expression 4 reuses the softmax formula but incorrectly applies the parameter vector for "Personal" in place of "Business", thus calculating the probability of the wrong category.

5. Expression 5 is incorrect because it subtracts exponentiated dot products, which does not reflect how probabilities are calculated in multinomial logistic regression.

Therefore, the correct choice is the first one.

## Correct Answer
1. $P(\text{"Business"} | x) = \frac{e^{\theta_{business}^T x}}{e^{\theta_{business}^T x} + e^{\theta_{personal}^T x} + e^{\theta_{spam}^T x}}$

## Reasoning
This question evaluates understanding of multinomial logistic regression, a fundamental concept for handling multi-class classification tasks in natural language processing. The solution requires knowledge of the softmax function, which generalizes logistic regression by calculating the probabilities of each class based on the exponentiation of linear combinations of features, normalized across all classes. The correct reasoning involves distinguishing this multinomial approach from binary logistic regression and recognizing how to apply it to compute class-specific probabilities correctly.
