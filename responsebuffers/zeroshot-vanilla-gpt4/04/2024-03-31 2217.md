## Question
A researcher is developing a natural language processing (NLP) system to categorize social media posts into one of three sentiment categories: positive, neutral, and negative. They decide to use multinomial logistic regression for this multi-class classification task. The researcher intends to enhance the model's generalization to unseen data by incorporating L2 regularization. Given the cost function $J(\theta)$ for multinomial logistic regression without regularization, and knowing that L2 regularization is represented as $\frac{\lambda}{2m} \sum_{j=1}^{n} \theta_j^2$, where $\lambda$ is the regularization parameter, $m$ is the number of samples, and $\theta$ represents the model parameters (excluding the bias terms), how would the cost function $J(\theta)$ be modified to include L2 regularization?

1. $J(\theta) + \frac{\lambda}{2m} \sum_{j=1}^{n} \theta_j$
2. $J(\theta) + \frac{\lambda}{m} \sum_{j=1}^{n} \theta_j^2$
3. $J(\theta) + \frac{1}{2m} \sum_{j=1}^{n} \theta_j^2$
4. $J(\theta) + \frac{\lambda}{2} \sum_{j=1}^{n} \theta_j^2$
5. $J(\theta) + \frac{\lambda}{2m} \sum_{j=1}^{n} \theta_j^2$

## Solution

To solve this question, let's first understand the components given and involved in the question.

The cost function $J(\theta)$ of multinomial logistic regression aims to maximize the likelihood of the correct class predictions. This likelihood is often transformed into a cost using the negative log-likelihood, thus needing minimization.

L2 regularization is used to prevent the model's coefficients from fitting too perfectly to the training data, which can cause overfitting. It accomplishes this by adding a penalty on the size of the coefficients, which is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the coefficients, hence the term $\sum_{j=1}^{n} \theta_j^2$. The regularization parameter $\lambda$ controls the strength of this penalty; larger values of $\lambda$ result in smaller coefficients, pushing the model towards underfitting, while smaller values allow the coefficients more freedom, risking overfitting.

Given that the cost function for multinomial logistic regression is $J(\theta)$ and we want to include L2 regularization, we combine the two components as follows:

$$J(\theta)_{\text{regularized}} = J(\theta) + \frac{\lambda}{2m} \sum_{j=1}^{n} \theta_j^2$$

The term $\frac{\lambda}{2m} \sum_{j=1}^{n} \theta_j^2$ represents the L2 regularization component, added to the original cost function $J(\theta)$. 
This regularization term adds a penalty to the cost function based on the values of the model parameters $\theta$, except for the bias term, which is typically not regularized. The division by $2m$ is to average the regularization penalty over all $m$ samples, and multiplication by $\frac{\lambda}{2}$ adjusts the regularization's strength.

## Correct Answer

5. $J(\theta) + \frac{\lambda}{2m} \sum_{j=1}^{n} \theta_j^2$

## Reasoning

Answer 5 correctly modifies the original cost function $J(\theta)$ by adding an L2 regularization term, as per the definition given in the question. Hereâ€™s the breakdown of why other options are incorrect:

1. This option incorrectly uses the sum of the parameters $\theta_j$, rather than the sum of their squares. It also misses the multiplication by $\frac{\lambda}{2m}$.
2. This choice does not divide the regularization strength by the number of samples, $m$, correctly, making its penalty scale incorrectly with the size of the dataset.
3. This choice lacks the regularization parameter $\lambda$, which is essential for adjusting the strength of the regularization.
4. This option incorrectly applies regularization strength $\lambda$ without averaging it over all $m$ samples, making the penalty insensitive to the size of the dataset.

Only the 5th choice correctly formulates the regularization term and combines it with the original cost function, following the principles of L2 regularization for multinomial logistic regression.
