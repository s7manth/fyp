## Question
Consider you are designing a natural language processing system aimed at classifying text messages into one of three categories: "spam", "important", or "casual". For this task, you choose to implement a multinomial logistic regression model. During your experimentation phase, you realize that the model is overfitting on the training data. To counteract this, you decide to implement L2 regularization into your learning algorithm. 

Given the cost function $J(\theta)$ for multinomial logistic regression without regularization, represented as:

$$J(\theta) = - \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} \sum_{k=1}^{K} \left[ y_k^{(i)} \log \left( \frac{e^{\theta_k^T x^{(i)}}}{\sum_{j=1}^{K} e^{\theta_j^T x^{(i)}}} \right) \right]$$

where:
- $m$ is the number of training examples,
- $K$ is the number of classes,
- $y_k^{(i)}$ is the binary indicator (0 or 1) if class label $k$ is the correct classification for observation $i$,
- $x^{(i)}$ represents the feature set of the $i^{th}$ observation,
- $\theta_j$ is the parameter vector for class $j$,

and the L2 regularization term added to the cost function is given by:

$$\Omega(\theta) = \frac{\lambda}{2m} \sum_{k=1}^{K} \sum_{j=0}^{n} \theta_{kj}^2$$

where:
- $\lambda$ is the regularization parameter,
- $n$ is the number of features excluding the bias term,

what would be the gradient of the regularized cost function with respect to the parameter $\theta_{kj}$ for any class $k$ and feature $j$?

1. $\frac{\partial J}{\partial \theta_{kj}} = - \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} \left( x_j^{(i)} \left( y_k^{(i)} - \frac{e^{\theta_k^T x^{(i)}}}{\sum_{l=1}^{K} e^{\theta_l^T x^{(i)}}} \right) \right) + \frac{\lambda}{m} \theta_{kj} $
2. $\frac{\partial J}{\partial \theta_{kj}} = - \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} \left( x_j^{(i)} \left( y_k^{(i)} - \frac{e^{\theta_k^T x^{(i)}}}{\sum_{l=1}^{K} e^{\theta_l^T x^{(i)}}} \right) \right) - \frac{\lambda}{m} \theta_{kj} $
3. $\frac{\partial J}{\partial \theta_{kj}} = - \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} \left( x_j^{(i)} \left( y_k^{(i)} - \frac{e^{\theta_k^T x^{(i)}}}{\sum_{l=1}^{K} e^{\theta_l^T x^{(i)}}} \right) \right) $
4. $\frac{\partial J}{\partial \theta_{kj}} = - \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} \left( x_j^{(i)}\left( y_k^{(i)} - \frac{e^{\theta_k^T x^{(i)}}}{\sum_{l=1}^{K} e^{\theta_l^T x^{(i)}}} \right) \right) + \lambda \theta_{kj} $
5. $\frac{\partial J}{\partial \theta_{kj}} = - \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} \left( x_j^{(i)}\left( y_k^{(i)} - \frac{e^{\theta_k^T x^{(i)}}}{\sum_{l=1}^{K} e^{\theta_l^T x^{(i)}}} \right) \right) $

## Solution
To solve for the gradient of the regularized cost function with respect to the parameter $\theta_{kj}$, we'll start by acknowledging that the derivative of the cost function $J(\theta)$ with respect to $\theta_{kj}$, without considering regularization, is identified in the first part of options 1 and 2. The expression represents the derivative of the cost function for multinomial logistic regression, which accounts for the difference between the predicted probability and the actual class ($y_k^{(i)}$) for each class $k$ weighted by the feature value $x_j^{(i)}$.

Next, when adding L2 regularization, the impact on the gradient is an additional term derived from the derivative of $\Omega(\theta) = \frac{\lambda}{2m} \sum_{k=1}^{K} \sum_{j=0}^{n} \theta_{kj}^2$ with respect to $\theta_{kj}$. The derivative of this term with respect to $\theta_{kj}$ simplifies to $\frac{\lambda}{m}\theta_{kj}$ since the derivative of $\theta_{kj}^2$ with respect to $\theta_{kj}$ is $2\theta_{kj}$, and the 2 cancels out with the 1/2 in the expression for $\Omega(\theta)$.

Adding this regularization term to the gradient of the unregularized cost function, we obtain the correct regularized gradient expression:

$$\frac{\partial J}{\partial \theta_{kj}} = - \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} \left( x_j^{(i)}\left( y_k^{(i)} - \frac{e^{\theta_k^T x^{(i)}}}{\sum_{l=1}^{K} e^{\theta_l^T x^{(i)}}} \right) \right) + \frac{\lambda}{m} \theta_{kj} $$

Therefore, the correct answer is option 1.

## Correct Answer
1. $\frac{\partial J}{\partial \theta_{kj}} = - \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} \left( x_j^{(i)} \left( y_k^{(i)} - \frac{e^{\theta_k^T x^{(i)}}}{\sum_{l=1}^{K} e^{\theta_l^T x^{(i)}}} \right) \right) + \frac{\lambda}{m} \theta_{kj} $

## Reasoning
The gradient of the regularized cost function combines two components: the gradient of the original cost function (which captures the prediction error per class and feature) and the gradient of the L2 regularization term (which penalizes large values of parameters to prevent overfitting). The correct expression must account for both the influence of the model's performance on the training data and the effect of regularization. By adding the regularization term's derivative, we ensure that the model penalizes higher parameter values, thereby mitigating overfitting. The inclusion of the regularization term in the gradient computation, proportional to each parameter value $\theta_{kj}$, effectively balances the model's complexity with its performance on the training data.
