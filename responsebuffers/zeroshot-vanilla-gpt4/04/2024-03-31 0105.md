## Question

In the context of natural language processing (NLP), a data scientist is employing multinomial logistic regression to classify news articles into one of three categories: business, sports, or technology. The model has been trained using a dataset of labeled news articles, and the softmax function is used in the last layer for the output probabilities. The scientist wants to employ L2 regularization to prevent overfitting, as they suspect the model has been learning the noise in the training data.

Given the training objective for multinomial logistic regression with L2 regularization, which of the following equations correctly represents the modified loss function the scientist should minimize using gradient descent?

1. $$J(\theta) = -\frac{1}{m} \left[ \sum_{i=1}^{m} \sum_{k=1}^{K} y_{ik} \log(\hat{p}_{ik}) \right] + \frac{\lambda}{2m} \sum_{j=1}^{n} \theta_j^2$$
2. $$J(\theta) = -\frac{1}{m} \left[ \sum_{i=1}^{m} \sum_{k=1}^{K} y_{ik} \log(\hat{p}_{ik}) \right] + \frac{\lambda}{2m} \sum_{j=1}^{n} ||\theta_j||_1$$
3. $$J(\theta) = -\frac{1}{m} \left[ \sum_{i=1}^{m} \sum_{k=1}^{K} y_{ik} \log(\hat{p}_{ik}) \right] + \frac{\lambda}{2} \sum_{j=1}^{n} \theta_j^2$$
4. $$J(\theta) = -\frac{1}{m} \left[ \sum_{i=1}^{m} \sum_{k=1}^{K} y_{ik} \log(\hat{p}_{ik}) \right] - \frac{\lambda}{2m} \sum_{j=1}^{n} \theta_j^2$$
5. $$J(\theta) = -\frac{1}{m} \left[ \sum_{i=1}^{m} \sum_{k=1}^{K} \log\left(\frac{e^{\theta_k^T x_i}}{\sum_{j=1}^{K} e^{\theta_j^T x_i}}\right) \right] + \frac{\lambda}{2m} \sum_{j=1}^{n} \theta_j^2$$

## Solution

The loss function for multinomial logistic regression uses the cross-entropy loss to compute the difference between the actual labels and the predicted probabilities. For K classes, the prediction for class $k$ for the $i^{th}$ sample is represented as $\hat{p}_{ik}$, and the actual label is $y_{ik}$ (which is 1 if the sample belongs to class $k$, else 0). Minimizing this cross-entropy loss helps the model learn the correct class probabilities.

The L2 regularization term is added to the loss function to penalize large weights, thereby preventing overfitting. It is represented by $\frac{\lambda}{2} \sum_{j=1}^{n} \theta_j^2$, where $\lambda$ is the regularization parameter, and $\theta_j$ represents the model parameters (except the bias term). The factor $\frac{1}{2m}$ is included when averaging the regularization term over $m$ training samples to maintain consistency with the loss component's average.

Given these considerations, the modified loss function combining both the cross-entropy loss for multinomial logistic regression and the L2 regularization in an average form (to normalize over the number of samples) is:

$$J(\theta) = -\frac{1}{m} \left[ \sum_{i=1}^{m} \sum_{k=1}^{K} y_{ik} \log(\hat{p}_{ik}) \right] + \frac{\lambda}{2m} \sum_{j=1}^{n} \theta_j^2$$

Therefore, the correct equation that represents the modified loss function the scientist should minimize using gradient descent is:

1. $$J(\theta) = -\frac{1}{m} \left[ \sum_{i=1}^{m} \sum_{k=1}^{K} y_{ik} \log(\hat{p}_{ik}) \right] + \frac{\lambda}{2m} \sum_{j=1}^{n} \theta_j^2$$

## Correct Answer

1. $$J(\theta) = -\frac{1}{m} \left[ \sum_{i=1}^{m} \sum_{k=1}^{K} y_{ik} \log(\hat{p}_{ik}) \right] + \frac{\lambda}{2m} \sum_{j=1}^{n} \theta_j^2$$

## Reasoning

The solution was derived by considering the following key aspects:
- The cross-entropy loss for multinomial logistic regression, which measures the discrepancy between actual and predicted class probabilities for $K$ classes across $m$ samples.
- The L2 regularization term, which prevents overfitting by penalizing large weights. It directly involves the square of the magnitude of the weights, scaled by the regularization parameter $\lambda$.
- The loss function must combine both the cross-entropy loss and the regularization term. The regularization term is averaged over $m$ samples by including the factor $\frac{1}{m}$, consistent with how the average loss is computed.

Option 1 accurately represents this combination and is therefore the correct answer. It scales the regularization term by the number of samples and the regularization parameter, exactly what's needed to prevent overfitting by penalizing large coefficients while still focusing on minimizing the primary loss function (cross-entropy loss in this case).
