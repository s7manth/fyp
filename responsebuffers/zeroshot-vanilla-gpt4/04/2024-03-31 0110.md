## Question

Given a dataset for a binary classification problem, you've decided to use Logistic Regression to model the probability that each instance belongs to a particular class. After training your model, you wish to interpret the model coefficients to understand the importance of each feature. Let's say the dataset consists of three numerical features: $x_1$, $x_2$, and $x_3$. The logistic regression model's parameters after training are $\beta_0 = 2$, $\beta_1 = -0.5$, $\beta_2 = 3$, and $\beta_3 = -1$, where $\beta_0$ is the intercept, and $\beta_1$, $\beta_2$, and $\beta_3$ are the coefficients for $x_1$, $x_2$, and $x_3$, respectively.

You want to use this model to predict the likelihood of the positive class (denoted as class 1). The logistic function is used to map the weighted sum of the features (plus the intercept) to a probability between 0 and 1. Recall the logistic function is defined as $\sigma(z) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}$, where $z = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot x_1 + \beta_2 \cdot x_2 + \beta_3 \cdot x_3$.

Which of the following statements is true regarding the interpretation of this model's coefficients?

1. A unit increase in $x_1$ decreases the likelihood of the instance being in class 1 by a factor of 0.5, assuming other features stay constant.
2. A unit increase in $x_2$ increases the odds of the instance being in class 1 threefold, assuming other features stay constant.
3. A unit increase in $x_2$ results in the probability of the instance being in class 1 increasing by 3, holding other features constant.
4. A unit increase in $x_3$ increases the probability of the instance being in class 1, assuming other features remain constant.
5. The intercept $\beta_0$ represents the odds of an instance with all feature values equal to 0 being in class 1.

## Solution

To interpret the model coefficients in the context of logistic regression, first, we need to understand how changes in feature values impact the output probability. Specifically, the coefficient ($\beta_i$) associated with a feature ($x_i$) indicates how a unit change in $x_i$ affects the log odds of the dependent variable being in the positive class (class 1), holding all other features constant.

- For $\beta_1 = -0.5$, this means a unit increase in $x_1$ will decrease the log odds of being in class 1 by 0.5, assuming $x_2$ and $x_3$ remain fixed. This implies a decrease in the likelihood but does not quantify it as a "factor of 0.5 decrease in likelihood". Hence, statement 1 is misleading.
- $\beta_2 = 3$ suggests that a unit increase in $x_2$ increases the log odds of the event occurring (class 1) by 3. This change in log odds can be interpreted as making the event more likely but does not directly translate to "increasing the odds threefold" in the intuitive sense of tripling the original odds. The accurate interpretation involves the exponential impact on the odds, not a simple tripling, hence statement 2 is incorrect.
- Statement 3 is incorrect because adding a unit to $x_2$ does not simply add a constant value (e.g., 3) to the probability of class 1. Logistic regression outputs the probability that an instance belongs to a class through the logistic function, and the coefficients affect the log odds, not the probability linearly.
- For $\beta_3 = -1$, a unit increase in $x_3$, holding other variables constant, decreases the log odds of being classified as class 1. This results in a lower probability of the instance being classed as 1, making statement 4 incorrect.
- $\beta_0 = 2$ is the intercept term, which represents the log odds of an instance being in class 1 when all $x_i$ are 0. The intercept influences the baseline probability but doesn't directly represent the odds of class 1 when all features are 0. The statement 5 simplifies this interpretation inaccurately.

Therefore, all given statements contain inaccuracies or misinterpretations regarding logistic regression coefficients' effects on class probabilities or odds.

## Correct Answer

None of the statements accurately describe the interpretation of the logistic regression model's coefficients.

## Reasoning

In logistic regression:
- A coefficient $\beta_i$ reflects how a unit change in $x_i$ impacts the log odds of the dependent variable being class 1 versus class 0, holding all other variables constant.
- Increases/decreases in feature values impact the log odds of the positive class in the directionality indicated by the sign of the respective coefficient.
- The intercept, $\beta_0$, sets the baseline log odds of being in class 1 when all $x_i$ are 0.
- Odds are the exponential function of log odds, so the coefficients affect the odds multiplicatively, not additively.
- The logistic function transforms these log odds into a probability, making the relationship between feature changes and probability changes nonlinear.
