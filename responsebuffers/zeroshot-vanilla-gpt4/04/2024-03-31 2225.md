## Question

Given a dataset that comprises three linearly separable classes, you aim to build a classification model using multinomial logistic regression. You decide to use the softmax function for the output layer to handle multiple classes and implement the cross-entropy loss function to evaluate the performance of your model.

Considering the importance of regularization to prevent overfitting, you integrate L2 regularization into your model. During the training phase, you utilize gradient descent to minimize the loss function, which now includes the regularization term.

Which of the following options correctly describes the gradient of the cross-entropy loss function with L2 regularization, to be used in gradient descent for updating the weights of your multinomial logistic regression model?

1. $\nabla J(\theta) = -\frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m}\left( y^{(i)} - \sigma(\theta^T x^{(i)}) \right)x^{(i)} + \lambda\theta$
2. $\nabla J(\theta) = -\frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m}\left( y^{(i)} - \text{softmax}(\theta^T x^{(i)}) \right)x^{(i)}$
3. $\nabla J(\theta) = -\frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m}\left( y^{(i)} - \text{softmax}(\theta^T x^{(i)}) \right)x^{(i)} + \lambda\theta$
4. $\nabla J(\theta) = -\frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m}\left( y^{(i)} - \sigma(\theta^T x^{(i)}) \right)x^{(i)}$
5. $\nabla J(\theta) = -\frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^{N}\left( y^{(n)} - \text{softmax}(\theta^Tx^{(n)}) \right)x^{(n)} + \frac{\lambda}{2}\theta^2$

## Solution

The correct update rule should account for both the derivative of the cross-entropy loss function using the softmax function and the derivative of the L2 regularization term.

First, the softmax function is used in multinomial logistic regression for transforming the linear inputs to probabilities that sum up to 1 across all classes. For class $k$ and input $x^{(i)}$, this is represented as 

$$\text{softmax}(\theta^T x^{(i)})_k = \frac{e^{\theta_k^T x^{(i)}}}{\sum_{j} e^{\theta_j^T x^{(i)}}}$$

where $\theta_k$ represents the parameter vector for class $k$.

For the cross-entropy loss with $C$ classes, the loss for a single instance is given by 

$$J(\theta) = -\sum_{k=1}^{C} y_k \log(\text{softmax}(\theta^T x^{(i)})_k)$$

where $y_k$ is a binary indicator of whether class $k$ is the correct classification for instance $i$.

L2 regularization is added to the loss function as $\frac{\lambda}{2}\|\theta\|^2$, which, when differentiated with respect to the parameters $\theta$, gives $\lambda\theta$.

The gradient of the cross-entropy loss for multinomial logistic regression with L2 regularization, therefore, combines the gradient due to data and the gradient due to regularization, resulting in the following formulation:

$$\nabla J(\theta) = -\frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m}\left( y^{(i)} - \text{softmax}(\theta^T x^{(i)}) \right)x^{(i)} + \lambda\theta$$

This gradient is used in gradient descent to iteratively update the weight vectors $\theta_k$ for class $k$ to minimize the loss.

## Correct Answer

3. $\nabla J(\theta) = -\frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m}\left( y^{(i)} - \text{softmax}(\theta^T x^{(i)}) \right)x^{(i)} + \lambda\theta$

## Reasoning

Given the task is to use multinomial logistic regression with L2 regularization, key components to consider are the softmax function and the cross-entropy loss for multi-class classification along with the regularization term's effect on the gradient.

Option 3 precisely combines the gradient of the cross-entropy loss that uses the softmax function for predicting class probabilities and incorporates the L2 regularization term's derivative, which is simply $\lambda\theta$. This is the correct gradient formula to use in the gradient descent algorithm for parameter updates in multinomial logistic regression with L2 regularization, ensuring both efficient learning and regularization to mitigate overfitting.
