## Question
A machine learning engineer is developing a sentiment analysis model to classify product reviews into three categories: "positive", "neutral", and "negative". The engineer decides to use Multinomial Logistic Regression (MLR) for this task. After training, the model outputs logits, which are then passed through a softmax function to get the probabilities of each class. To improve the model's performance, the engineer explores different regularization techniques. Given the importance of interpretability and preventing overfitting in this context, which of the following regularization techniques would be most appropriate to apply in this scenario?

1. L1 (Lasso) regularization only
2. L2 (Ridge) regularization only
3. Elastic Net regularization
4. Batch Normalization as a form of regularization
5. Dropout as a form of regularization

## Solution
The most appropriate regularization technique in this context, considering the importance of interpretability and preventing overfitting, is **1. L1 (Lasso) regularization only**.

## Correct Answer
1. L1 (Lasso) regularization only

## Reasoning
When choosing a regularization technique for a Multinomial Logistic Regression model, especially in a scenario that demands high interpretability, such as sentiment analysis of product reviews, the key considerations include the method's ability to prevent overfitting and its impact on model interpretability.

- **L1 (Lasso) regularization** is known for its ability to produce sparse models by pushing the coefficients of less important features to zero. This property not only helps in preventing overfitting by penalizing the absolute size of the coefficients (thus keeping the model simple), but it also aids in model interpretability. A sparse model means that only a subset of all the features contributes to the predictions, making it easier to understand which features are most influential. Therefore, L1 regularization is particularly useful when interpretability is a priority.

- **L2 (Ridge) regularization** penalizes the square of the coefficients, which tends to shrink the coefficients uniformly but does not necessarily drive them to zero. This can prevent overfitting by encouraging smaller, more conservative coefficients, but it does not enhance sparsity and hence interpretability as effectively as L1 regularization.

- **Elastic Net regularization** is a combination of L1 and L2 regularization and can potentially offer a balance between feature selection and coefficient shrinkage. While it can be effective in certain scenarios, it might not always provide the level of sparsity and interpretability achieved by L1 regularization alone.

- **Batch Normalization** is a technique primarily used to stabilize and accelerate the training process of deep neural networks by normalizing the input of each layer. While it can indirectly act as a form of regularization by reducing internal covariate shift, it does not directly contribute to sparsity or interpretability in the context of Multinomial Logistic Regression.

- **Dropout** is a regularization technique used in deep learning that randomly "drops out" a subset of neurons in a layer during training. This prevents co-adaptation of neurons and can help in reducing overfitting. However, similar to batch normalization, dropout does not directly contribute to interpretability or sparsity in logistic regression models.

Given the importance of producing an interpretable model while also preventing overfitting, **L1 (Lasso) regularization** is the most appropriate choice for this scenario.
