## Question

Given a natural language processing (NLP) task where you are trying to classify text messages into one of three categories: "Spam", "Important", or "Casual", you decide to use multinomial logistic regression for this purpose. Your feature vector $\vec{x}$ is derived from the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) of the words in the messages, and you have a training dataset of several thousand labeled messages.

After training your model, you decide to interpret the learned weights to understand the importance of different words for each category. For a word $w$ that has a relatively high positive weight in the "Spam" class and negative weights in the "Important" and "Casual" classes, what can you infer about the role of this word in your model's classification process?

1. The word $w$ is likely a common English stop word that does not contribute much information for classification.
2. The word $w$ is indicative of the "Spam" category but is common in non-spam messages, leading to a higher false positive rate for the "Spam" classification.
3. The word $w$ is strongly indicative of the "Spam" category and unlikely to appear in messages classified as "Important" or "Casual".
4. The word $w$ has been incorrectly weighted due to an error in the gradient descent optimization process.
5. The presence of the word $w$ in a message significantly increases the likelihood of that message being mistakenly classified as "Important".

## Solution

To answer this question, let's break down the implications of the given information about the weights assigned to the word $w$ in a multinomial logistic regression model. 

In multinormal logistic regression, each class will have its own set of weights, and the significance of these weights is interpreted in relation to how strongly they are associated with the classification into that particular class. A positive weight for a word in relation to a given class indicates a positive correlation between the presence (or frequency) of that word in a text and the likelihood of the text being classified into that class. Conversely, a negative weight implies a negative correlation with the class.

Given that word $w$ has a "relatively high positive weight in the 'Spam' class" and negative weights in both the "Important" and "Casual" classes, several inferences can be made:

- The positive weight for the "Spam" category suggests that the presence of $w$ is a strong signal for classifying messages as spam. It indicates that $w$ is significantly more likely to appear in messages labeled as "Spam" compared to the other classes.
- The negative weights for the "Important" and "Casual" categories imply that the presence of $w$ negatively affects the probability of messages being classified into these categories. This means that $w$ is less likely to appear in messages that are not spam.

Based on these observations, the correct inference is that the word $w$ is strongly indicative of the "Spam" category and unlikely to appear in messages classified as "Important" or "Casual".

## Correct Answer

3. The word $w$ is strongly indicative of the "Spam" category and unlikely to appear in messages classified as "Important" or "Casual".

## Reasoning

The inference is grounded in the understanding of multinomial logistic regression and the role of weights in determining the relationship between features (in this case, words) and class labels. A high positive weight for a word in relation to one class (here, "Spam") along with negative weights for the same word in relation to other classes, indicates that the word is a strong predictor for the former class and a weak or negative predictor for the latter classes. The observed weighting pattern for $w$—positive for "Spam" and negative for "Important" and "Casual"—demonstrates that the model has learned to associate the presence of $w$ with a higher likelihood of a message being spam, while its presence decreases the likelihood of the message belonging to the other two categories. This is exactly how multinomial logistic regression aims to differentiate between multiple classes based on the calculated probabilities.
