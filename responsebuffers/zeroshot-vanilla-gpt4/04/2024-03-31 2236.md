## Question
In the context of optimizing a logistic regression model for binary classification, the cross-entropy loss function is commonly used due to its probabilistic interpretation and its property of being convex, facilitating the application of gradient descent for finding the model parameters. Given a dataset with features $(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)$ and binary labels $(y_1, y_2, ..., y_n)$ where $y_i \in \{0,1\}$, and a logistic regression model which predicts the probability of the positive class as $\hat{y}_i = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i1} + ... + \beta_n x_{in})}}$, the cross-entropy loss (also known as the logistic loss) for the entire dataset can be written as:

$$L(\vec{\beta}) = - \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} [y_i \log(\hat{y}_i) + (1 - y_i) \log(1 - \hat{y}_i)]$$

Where $N$ is the number of samples, $\vec{\beta}$ represents the vector of model parameters including the intercept $\beta_0$ and feature weights $\beta_1, \beta_2, ..., \beta_n$, and $\log$ is the natural logarithm. Considering the role of gradient descent in minimizing $L(\vec{\beta})$, which of the following describes the update rule for the parameter vector $\vec{\beta}$ at each iteration, when the learning rate is denoted by $\alpha$?

1. $\vec{\beta}_{new} = \vec{\beta} + \alpha \nabla_{\vec{\beta}} L(\vec{\beta})$
2. $\vec{\beta}_{new} = \vec{\beta} - \alpha \frac{\partial L(\vec{\beta})}{\partial \vec{\beta}}$
3. $\vec{\beta}_{new} = \vec{\beta} + \alpha \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)x_{i}$
4. $\vec{\beta}_{new} = \vec{\beta} - \alpha \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (\hat{y}_i - y_i)x_{i}$
5. $\vec{\beta}_{new} = \vec{\beta} - \alpha \nabla_{\vec{\beta}} \frac{\partial L(\vec{\beta})}{\partial \vec{\beta}}$

## Solution
First, let's break down the logic required to reach the correct answer. The update rule in gradient descent is central to improving the parameters of our model in the direction that minimizes the loss. The gradient of the loss function ($\nabla_{\vec{\beta}} L(\vec{\beta})$ or $\frac{\partial L(\vec{\beta})}{\partial \vec{\beta}}$) gives the direction of the steepest ascent. To minimize the loss, we want to move in the opposite direction, hence we subtract the gradient multiplied by the learning rate ($\alpha$) from the current parameters.

Given this context, let's evaluate each option:

1. This choice incorrectly suggests addition rather than subtraction of the gradient, which would lead to moving in the direction of steepest increase of the loss function, not its decrease.
   
2. This is the correct mathematical representation of the gradient descent update rule, with subtraction indicating moving against the gradient direction, thus towards minimizing the loss.
   
3. This represents a simplification of the gradient descent update rule specifically for logistic regression but incorrectly suggests addition instead of subtraction.
   
4. This is a simplified, correct update rule for logistic regression that captures the idea of modifying $\vec{\beta}$ by subtracting a fraction of the gradient. However, it lacks generality and the formal notation of gradients.
   
5. This option mixed up the notation without correctly reflecting the gradient descent rule or the calculation of the gradient.

The correct update rule must involve subtracting the gradient of the loss function, scaled by a learning rate from the current parameters. As such, the correct form is reflected by option 2, which uses the standard and accurate notation for applying the gradient descent update rule in the context of logistic regression.

## Correct Answer
2. $\vec{\beta}_{new} = \vec{\beta} - \alpha \frac{\partial L(\vec{\beta})}{\partial \vec{\beta}}$

## Reasoning
The correct choice is largely based on understanding the fundamental principles of gradient descent optimization. In gradient descent, the parameters are updated by subtracting the product of the learning rate and the gradient of the loss function with respect to the parameters. This process iteratively moves the parameters towards the minimum of the loss function, effectively training the logistic regression model. The notation $\frac{\partial L(\vec{\beta})}{\partial \vec{\beta}}$ represents the gradient of the loss function with respect to the parameter vector $\vec{\beta}$, encapsulating the effect of all model parameters in the optimization process. Choice 2 correctly applies these principles using precise mathematical notation, aligning with the theoretical foundation of gradient descent and its application in logistic regression optimization.
