## Question
Given a dataset with three classes (A, B, and C), you are developing a multinomial logistic regression model to predict the class based on two features, $x_1$ and $x_2$. During the model evaluation, you noticed overfitting. To address this concern, you decided to apply L2 regularization to the learning process. Which of the following correctly describes the effect of introducing L2 regularization on the gradient descent updates for the model coefficients associated with class A ($\boldsymbol{\theta}_A$) for feature $x_1$ during training?

1. L2 regularization will have no effect on the gradient updates for $\boldsymbol{\theta}_A$ for feature $x_1$ because regularization only affects the bias term.
2. The gradient update for $\boldsymbol{\theta}_A$ for feature $x_1$ will be the same as without regularization, but there will be an additional step to reduce the magnitude of $\boldsymbol{\theta}_A$ after each update.
3. The introduction of L2 regularization leads to a gradient update for $\boldsymbol{\theta}_A$ for feature $x_1$ that includes a term proportional to the value of $\boldsymbol{\theta}_A$ itself, effectively shrinking its magnitude over iterations.
4. The updated gradient will be adjusted by a constant factor, regardless of the magnitude of $\boldsymbol{\theta}_A$ for feature $x_1$, to compensate for the overfitting.
5. L2 regularization causes the gradient updates for $\boldsymbol{\theta}_A$ for feature $x_1$ to depend inversely on its current magnitude, making larger weights adjust faster than smaller ones.

## Solution
L2 regularization, also known as ridge regularization, adds a penalty equal to the square of the magnitude of coefficients to the loss function. This discourages the model from fitting the training data too closely by penalizing large coefficients, thereby helping to address overfitting. The loss function for multinomial logistic regression with L2 regularization can be written as:

$$J(\boldsymbol{\theta}) = -\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{k=1}^{K} [y^{(i)}_k log(\hat{p}^{(i)}_k)] + \frac{\lambda}{2N} \sum_{j=1}^{m} \theta_j^2$$

where $N$ is the number of samples, $K$ is the number of classes, $y^{(i)}_k$ is a binary indicator of whether class $k$ is the correct classification for observation $i$, $\hat{p}^{(i)}_k$ is the predicted probability that observation $i$ is of class $k$, $m$ is the number of features, $\lambda$ is the regularization strength, and $\theta_j$ are the model coefficients.

The gradient of the loss function with respect to the model coefficients includes a term for the error in the predictions as in standard logistic regression, plus a term from the derivative of the regularization penalty with respect to $\theta_j$.

The derivative of $\frac{\lambda}{2N} \sum_{j=1}^{m} \theta_j^2$ with respect to $\theta_j$ (here specifically, for $\boldsymbol{\theta}_A$ for feature $x_1$) is $\frac{\lambda}{N} \theta_{A, x_1}$. Therefore, the gradient descent update for $\boldsymbol{\theta}_A$ for feature $x_1$ includes a term $\frac{\lambda}{N} \theta_{A, x_1}$, which effectively subtracts a portion of the value of $\boldsymbol{\theta}_A$ for feature $x_1$ on each update, thereby "shrinking" its magnitude over the iterations.

Thus, the correct description of introducing L2 regularization on the gradient descent updates for the model coefficients is:

3. The introduction of L2 regularization leads to a gradient update for $\boldsymbol{\theta}_A$ for feature $x_1$ that includes a term proportional to the value of $\boldsymbol{\theta}_A$ itself, effectively shrinking its magnitude over iterations.

## Correct Answer
3. The introduction of L2 regularization leads to a gradient update for $\boldsymbol{\theta}_A$ for feature $x_1$ that includes a term proportional to the value of $\boldsymbol{\theta}_A$ itself, effectively shrinking its magnitude over iterations.

## Reasoning
L2 regularization is directly applied to the model coefficients through the loss function in multinomial logistic regression, affecting the gradient descent updates by penalizing large coefficients to reduce overfitting. The penalty's effect on the gradient descent is specifically to add a term that is proportional to the value of the coefficient itself, which means that for each feature coefficient, part of its own value is subtracted during the update. This mechanism helps to reduce the model's complexity by encouraging smaller, and hence possibly more general, coefficients, which is particularly useful when addressing the issue of overfitting. This is reflected in choice 3, which correctly describes the influence of L2 regularization on the update mechanism for the coefficients in the context provided, thereby making it the correct answer.
