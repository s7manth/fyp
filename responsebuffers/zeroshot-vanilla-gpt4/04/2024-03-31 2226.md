## Question
Consider a multinomial logistic regression model being trained to classify text documents into five categories: Business, Entertainment, Politics, Sport, and Technology. The model uses a cross-entropy loss function, stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for optimization, and L2 regularization. After training, the model achieves a high accuracy on the training data but performs significantly worse on the validation data. To improve the model's performance on unseen data (i.e., reduce overfitting), you consider several strategies. Which of the following actions is most likely to improve the model's generalization performance?

1. Increase the learning rate for SGD to converge faster to the global minimum.
2. Increase the L2 regularization strength to penalize large weights more heavily.
3. Decrease the model's complexity by reducing the number of features used for prediction.
4. Manually modify weights of the underperforming classes to improve their classification accuracy.
5. Remove the L2 regularization term entirely to allow more flexibility in the model's weight adjustments.

## Solution

### Correct Answer
2. Increase the L2 regularization strength to penalize large weights more heavily.

### Reasoning

Start by understanding the problem: the model is overfitting, indicated by high performance on training data but significantly worse performance on validation data. Overfitting occurs when a model is too complex, capturing noise in the training data that does not generalize to unseen data. The goal is to improve the model's generalization performance, meaning strategies that reduce overfitting are most relevant.

1. **Increasing the learning rate for SGD**: This might make the optimization process converge faster, but it does not address overfitting directly. Indeed, a too high learning rate can skip over minima, potentially worsening performance.

2. **Increasing the L2 regularization strength**: Regularization is a technique specifically designed to prevent overfitting by penalizing larger weights in the model, thus encouraging simpler models that generalize better. L2 regularization adds a penalty equivalent to the square of the magnitude of coefficients and effectively limits the influence of less important features. Hence, increasing the L2 regularization strength is a direct approach to reducing overfitting.

3. **Decreasing the model's complexity by reducing the number of features used for prediction**: This approach can help reduce overfitting by simplifying the model. However, arbitrarily reducing features without understanding their importance might lead to underfitting or loss of crucial information necessary for accurate predictions.

4. **Manually modifying weights of the underperforming classes**: This action does not follow a principled learning approach and could exacerbate overfitting by making the model perform even better on the training data without regard for generalization.

5. **Removing the L2 regularization term entirely**: This would likely increase overfitting because the model would no longer be penalized for complex weight configurations that fit the training data too closely.

Thus, the best strategy among the given options to improve the model's generalization performance and combat overfitting is to increase the L2 regularization strength.
