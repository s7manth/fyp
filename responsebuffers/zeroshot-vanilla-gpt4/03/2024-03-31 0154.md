## Question
A team of data scientists is developing a Naive Bayes classifier for sentiment analysis on movie reviews. Their dataset contains a sizable number of long and detailed reviews, but the team is facing significant computational challenges when training their model with the full dataset. They hypothesize that pre-processing the reviews by extracting only adjective and adverb phrases may not only reduce the computational cost but also improve the model's performance by focusing on more sentiment-laden parts of the text.

Which of the following outcomes would MOST likely result from this pre-processing step, and what would be a critical consideration the team needs to address to ensure the effectiveness of their approach?

1. The computational cost will decrease, but the model's performance might suffer due to the loss of contextual information.
2. The computational cost and model's performance will significantly improve because adjective and adverb phrases contain the most relevant sentiment information.
3. The model's performance will significantly deteriorate since Naive Bayes requires the full text to accurately estimate probabilities.
4. The computational cost will increase due to the complexity of the pre-processing step, but the model's performance will improve because of the enhanced data quality.
5. There will be no significant change in computational cost or model's performance since Naive Bayes classifiers inherently handle large datasets efficiently.

## Solution

The correct answer is 1. The computational cost will decrease, but the model's performance might suffer due to the loss of contextual information.

## Correct Answer

1. The computational cost will decrease, but the model's performance might suffer due to the loss of contextual information.

## Reasoning

When implementing a Naive Bayes classifier for a text classification task like sentiment analysis, computational efficiency and model performance are often impacted by the size and nature of the input data. Reducing the dataset by extracting only adjective and adverb phrases can indeed lower the computational cost. This efficiency gain comes from the fact that the classifier would need to process a much smaller set of features (words or phrases), given that not every word in a review contributes equally to its overall sentiment. Adjectives and adverbs are traditionally considered more directly related to sentiment, which justifies their selection.

However, this approach introduces a critical trade-off. Sentiment analysis often relies on contextual cues that span beyond individual adjectives and adverbs. Phrases that include nouns and verbs can significantly alter the sentiment conveyed by adjectives and adverbs. For example, the phrase "not only breathtakingly beautiful but also deeply moving" conveys a strong positive sentiment that might be diluted if we were to consider only the adjectives and adverbs. Therefore, while computational costs are reduced, the potential loss of contextual information could degrade the model's ability to accurately gauge sentiment.

A critical consideration for ensuring the effectiveness of this approach would be implementing methods to capture context adequately, even when focusing on adjectives and adverbs. This might involve looking at n-grams that include these parts of speech or employing techniques to weigh the sentiment of these words based on their surrounding context. Ensuring that the selected features (adjectives and adverbs) are representative of the overall sentiment requires careful feature engineering and possibly leveraging additional linguistic resources or more sophisticated preprocessing techniques that can infer context without necessitating the full text.
