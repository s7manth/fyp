## Question
In a natural language processing project focused on sentiment analysis of movie reviews, a team decided to use the Naive Bayes classifier due to its simplicity and efficiency for text classification tasks. The dataset consists of 10,000 movie reviews, with 5,000 labeled as positive and the other 5,000 as negative. After training the model, the team tests it on a separate test set of 2,000 reviews and employs precision, recall, and F-measure to evaluate its performance.

Given the following evaluation results obtained:

- Precision (Positive) = 0.76
- Recall (Positive) = 0.88
- Precision (Negative) = 0.85
- Recall (Negative) = 0.71

Choose the correct answer based on the information regarding how the team can further optimize the classifier's performance specifically for increasing the F-measure for the negative class sentiment analysis:

1. Increase the size of the training set by adding more reviews evenly for both classes.
2. Adjust the probability threshold used for classifying negative reviews to require a higher confidence.
3. Apply feature selection techniques to remove irrelevant or less informative features.
4. Utilize statistical significance testing to compare the performance of Naive Bayes with another algorithm and switch if the difference is significant.
5. Implement techniques for handling class imbalance, such as oversampling the negative reviews or undersampling the positive reviews.

## Solution

**Step 1**: Calculate current F-measure for Negative sentiment

The F-measure (F1 score) can be calculated using the precision and recall values. The formula for F-measure is:
$$F1 = 2 * \frac{\text{precision} * \text{recall}}{\text{precision} + \text{recall}}$$

For the Negative class:
$$F1_{Negative} = 2 * \frac{0.85 * 0.71}{0.85 + 0.71} \approx 0.773$$

**Step 2**: Evaluate options based on potential impact

- Increasing the size of the training dataset (Option 1) could generally improve model performance, but it might not specifically target the improvement of the F-measure for the negative class without a specific strategy to address what aspect of the negative class is underperforming.
  
- Adjusting the probability threshold (Option 2) for classifying reviews as negative to require higher confidence might directly address the issue of optimizing both precision and recall, especially if the model is currently misclassifying too many positive reviews as negative (thus hurting its precision).
  
- Applying feature selection techniques (Option 3) can indeed enhance the model by focusing on more relevant features, potentially boosting both precision and recall by relying on more discriminatory cues for classification.
  
- Utilizing statistical significance testing (Option 4) to compare algorithms is a good strategy for model selection but does not directly optimize the F-measure for the negative class of the currently chosen classifier.
  
- Implementing techniques for handling class imbalance (Option 5), such as oversampling or undersampling, seems not directly applicable here since the dataset is initially balanced with an equal number of positive and negative reviews. This option might not be the most efficient way to increase the F-measure for the negative class.

**Step 3**: Select the best option

Based on the above analysis, **adjusting the probability threshold (Option 2)** seems the most direct and effective strategy for specifically increasing the F-measure for the negative class. This could help in fine-tuning the balance between precision and recall for the negative class by potentially reducing the number of false positives (positive reviews incorrectly classified as negative), thus improving precision, which in this scenario could have a more significant impact on the F-measure.

## Correct Answer

2. Adjust the probability threshold used for classifying negative reviews to require a higher confidence.

## Reasoning

Adjusting the probability threshold for classifying negative reviews can more directly affect the precision and recall balance for the negative class. In cases where precision is relatively higher than recall (as with the negative class in this scenario), improving recall without significantly damaging precision can enhance the F-measure. By requiring a higher confidence to classify a review as negative, it's likely to reduce false positives (improve precision) or even improve recall if the threshold adjustment is done carefully to minimize misclassification of actual negatives as positives. This approach directly targets the optimization of both metrics that contribute to the F-measure for the negative class, making it a strategic choice.
