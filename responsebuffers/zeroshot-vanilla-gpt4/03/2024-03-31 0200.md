## Question
Given a Naive Bayes classifier trained for sentiment analysis on movie reviews, you aim to improve its performance which has been modest at best. After initial analysis, you find that the classifier's recall is significantly lower than its precision for the positive class. Which of the following steps could potentially increase the recall for the positive class without disproportionately reducing the overall accuracy?

1. Increase the prior probability of the positive class in the classifier.
2. Decrease the threshold for classifying a review as positive.
3. Use a more complex model like a neural network to capture nuanced expressions of positivity.
4. Add more features related to commonly missed positive expressions by incorporating a sentiment lexicon.
5. Cross-validate the model with a larger dataset to ensure the model is not overfitting to the training set.

## Solution

To solve this problem, we must first understand what recall is and why it might be low for the positive class in a sentiment analysis task. Recall, given by the formula $Recall = \frac{TP}{TP + FN}$ (where $TP$ is true positives and $FN$ is false negatives), measures the classifier's ability to identify all relevant instances.

Low recall for the positive class indicates that the classifier is missing out on correctly identifying many positive reviews (high FN). To address this, we need strategies that make the classifier more sensitive to positive instances.

1. **Increasing the prior probability of the positive class** could make the classifier biased towards predicting more instances as positive, possibly increasing the true positives but at the risk of also increasing false positives.
2. **Decreasing the threshold for classifying a review as positive** means a review doesn't need as high a probabilistic score (based on the Naive Bayes output) to be deemed positive. This is a direct way of increasing recall for the positive class by making it easier for reviews to be classified as positive.
3. **Using a more complex model like a neural network** could indeed improve performance by capturing more nuanced expressions, but it doesn't directly address the recall issue with the current model and could introduce complexity beyond what's asked in the question.
4. **Adding more features related to commonly missed positive expressions** by leveraging a sentiment lexicon could improve the classifier's ability to detect positive sentiments it previously missed, potentially increasing TP without affecting FP much.
5. **Cross-validating with a larger dataset** aims at ensuring robustness and generalization but doesn't directly target the recall issue.

The most direct and potentially effective solutions for increasing recall for the positive class without undue harm to overall accuracy or precision are options 2 and 4.

## Correct Answer

2. Decrease the threshold for classifying a review as positive.

## Reasoning

Decreasing the threshold for classifying reviews as positive directly addresses the need to reduce false negatives in predicting the positive class, thereby increasing recall. This solution focuses on the primary concern of improving the ability of the Naive Bayes classifier to recognize positive sentiments more liberally. While option 4 is also a viable approach, it entails adding more features to the model, which could improve performance but does not directly tackle the issue of the classifier's threshold. Reducing this decision boundary threshold is a more straightforward and immediate solution to increase recall, making option 2 the most fitting answer.
