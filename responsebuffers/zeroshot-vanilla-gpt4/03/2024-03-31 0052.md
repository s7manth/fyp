## Question

In the context of using Naive Bayes for sentiment analysis on movie reviews, a dataset contains an even distribution of positive and negative reviews. An experiment was conducted to optimize the classifier by incorporating bigram features alongside unigram features in the feature set. After training with this new feature set, the performance metrics on a separate test set showed that the precision for positive reviews significantly increased, but the recall for positive reviews decreased. What could be a potential reason for this observed change in performance metrics?

1. The inclusion of bigram features increased the feature space complexity, leading to overfitting on the training data.
2. The bigram features predominantly captured neutral sentiment expressions, thereby diluting the effect of strongly positive unigram features.
3. The Naive Bayes assumption of feature independence became more violated with the inclusion of bigram features, reducing the classifier's effectiveness.
4. The inclusion of bigram features inadvertently introduced more noise than informative content, making it harder for the classifier to generalize from the training to the testing data.
5. The test set contained more complex sentences that were not well represented in the training set, making it difficult for the classifier to accurately predict the sentiment.

## Solution

The correct answer to this question can be reasoned through understanding both the effect of adding bigram features to a Naive Bayes classifier and the implications of the changes in performance metrics (increased precision but decreased recall for positive reviews).

- Precision is calculated as the number of true positive predictions divided by the number of true positive and false positive predictions. An increase in precision for positive reviews implies that, of the reviews classified as positive, a higher proportion was truly positive. 
- Recall is calculated as the number of true positive predictions divided by the number of true positive predictions and false negatives. A decrease in recall for positive reviews means that a significant number of actual positive reviews were not identified by the classifier.

Among the options provided:
1. **Overfitting** could indeed result from a richer feature space but would likely affect both precision and recall negatively, as the model would not generalize well to unseen data.
2. **Neutral sentiment expressions** captured by bigram features do not directly explain the change in precision and recall.
3. The **violation of feature independence** is a plausible explanation as Naive Bayes relies on the assumption that features are independent given the class. Including bigram features introduces dependencies between features (since bigrams consider two consecutive words), potentially reducing the effectiveness of the independence assumption and thus the classifier's performance.
4. **Introduction of noise** could reasonably lead to a reduction in recall, as noise makes it harder to identify true positives. But it could also lead to a decrease in precision, which contradicts the observed increase in precision.
5. The **complexity of sentences in the test set** not being well represented in the training data is a concern for generalization but does not directly relate to the observed effects of adding bigram features.

Given these considerations, the most reasonable explanation is related to the effect of violating the Naive Bayes assumption of feature independence, reflected in option 3.

## Correct Answer

3. The Naive Bayes assumption of feature independence became more violated with the inclusion of bigram features, reducing the classifier's effectiveness.

## Reasoning

The inclusion of bigram features in a Naive Bayes classifier for text classification introduces dependencies between words, violating the fundamental assumption of feature independence that underpins the Naive Bayes model. This violation can impair the model's effectiveness, as the probability estimations become less accurate. When applied to sentiment analysis, where context and word order can significantly alter sentiment, this decrease in model effectiveness can manifest as less accurate classifications. Specifically, the reduction in recall for positive reviews could be attributed to the model's compromised ability to accurately associate the combined sentiment expressed through bigrams with positive sentiment, leading it to miss true positive reviews. The increase in precision suggests that when the model does predict positive sentiment, it does so with more confidence, likely because the incorrectly associated bigrams have been filtered out as noise for the positive class, albeit at the cost of not recognizing some truly positive sentiments.
