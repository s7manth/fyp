## Question
In an effort to improve the accuracy of a sentiment analysis system aimed at classifying movie reviews, a team of researchers decided to employ a Naive Bayes classifier. The initial system achieved decent performance but struggled with classifying sarcastic comments correctly. To address this issue, the team proposed incorporating additional features into the classifier beyond the traditional bag-of-words model. Which of the following feature sets is MOST likely to contribute to the Naive Bayes classifier's ability to correctly classify sarcastic comments in movie reviews?

1. Increasing the frequency counts of adjectives and adverbs only.
2. Incorporating bi-gram and tri-gram frequencies alongside the existing uni-gram frequencies.
3. Relying solely on the presence or absence of words with strong sentiment polarities.
4. Incorporating part-of-speech tags as additional features for each word in the corpus.
5. Including an external lexicon of movie-specific jargon and terminology.

## Solution
The key challenge here is understanding the nature of sarcasm and how it differs from straightforward emotional expression. Sarcasm often involves saying the opposite of what is meant, which can be subtly indicated through context and phrasing rather than simple word presence. Thus, the solution requires enhancing context understanding.

1. **Increasing the frequency counts of adjectives and adverbs only** does not directly address the issue of sarcasm recognition, as sarcasm relies more on context and phrasing than merely on the frequency of emotional descriptors.

2. **Incorporating bi-gram and tri-gram frequencies alongside the existing uni-gram frequencies** is a promising approach because sarcasm often relies on the specific arrangement of words rather than isolated terms. Bi-grams and tri-grams can capture these nuances better than uni-grams.

3. **Relying solely on the presence or absence of words with strong sentiment polarities** would not effectively detect sarcasm since sarcasm can employ words with a polar sentiment opposite to the intended meaning.

4. **Incorporating part-of-speech tags as additional features for each word in the corpus** could potentially improve understanding of sentence structure, but without considering the specific arrangement or context of these tags, it might not significantly contribute to detecting sarcasm.

5. **Including an external lexicon of movie-specific jargon and terminology** might enhance the model's ability to understand content specific to movie reviews but does not directly address the issue of recognizing sarcasm.

Therefore, the option that directly tackles the challenge of understanding the arrangement and context of words, crucial for sarcasm detection, is:

**Incorporating bi-gram and tri-gram frequencies alongside the existing uni-gram frequencies.**

## Correct Answer
2. Incorporating bi-gram and tri-gram frequencies alongside the existing uni-gram frequencies.

## Reasoning
The choice of incorporating bi-gram and tri-gram frequencies is justified by the nature of sarcasm, which often depends on the specific sequencing of words rather than just their presence. Bi-grams and tri-grams capture more contextual information than uni-grams, allowing the classifier to better understand nuances like sarcasm. This approach aligns with the theoretical understanding that context and phrase structure play crucial roles in sentiment analysis, especially when it involves complex linguistic constructs like sarcasm. Given the problem of sarcasm detection in movie reviews, the addition of bi-gram and tri-gram frequencies addresses the core issue by enhancing the classifier's ability to interpret the context and phrasing indicative of sarcastic remarks, thus improving accuracy in classifying such comments.
