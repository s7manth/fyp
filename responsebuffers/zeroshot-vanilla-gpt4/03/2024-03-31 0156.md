## Question
In a recent project, a data scientist is employing a Naive Bayes classifier for a sentiment analysis task on a dataset comprising movie reviews. The dataset has been divided into a training set and a test set. The classifier has been trained and its performance has been evaluated on the test set, achieving a precision of 0.85 and a recall of 0.75 for the "positive" class. However, the scientist wishes to improve the F1-score of the model further. To achieve this goal, which of the following strategies should the scientist consider implementing? 

1. Increase the size of the test set to include more examples of "positive" class reviews.
2. Apply feature selection techniques to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space based on TF-IDF scores.
3. Substitute the Naive Bayes classifier with a more complex model, such as a deep neural network, without further adjustment.
4. Adjust the probability threshold for classifying reviews as "positive" to optimize the balance between precision and recall.
5. Conduct statistical significance testing between the Naive Bayes classifier and a baseline model to identify significant performance differences.

## Solution
To improve the F1-score, the data scientist needs to find a balance between precision and recall, as the F1-score is the harmonic mean of these two metrics. It's calculated using the formula:

$$F1 = 2 \times \frac{\text{precision} \times \text{recall}}{\text{precision} + \text{recall}}$$

1. Increasing the size of the test set does not directly improve the model's F1-score on the existing test data.
2. Applying feature selection techniques like using TF-IDF scores might help in removing irrelevant features and could potentially improve the model's performance by focusing on more informative features. However, this strategy primarily targets model accuracy, not specifically the balance between precision and recall.
3. Switching to a more complex model like a deep neural network without considering adjustments specific to precision and recall balance does not guarantee an improved F1-score. Moreover, this doesn't leverage specific strengths of Naive Bayes for text classification and sentiment analysis.
4. Adjusting the probability threshold for classifying reviews as "positive" can directly impact both precision and recall by making the model more or less stringent in assigning the "positive" class. This method allows for a direct tuning of the trade-off between precision and recall, thereby providing a pathway to enhance the F1-score.
5. Statistical significance testing between models can provide insights into whether differences in performance metrics are meaningful, but it does not directly contribute to improving the F1-score of the Naive Bayes classifier.

Thus, the most effective strategy for the goal outlined would be to adjust the probability threshold for classifying reviews as "positive," as this approach directly addresses the balance between precision and recall, which in turn impacts the F1-score.

## Correct Answer
4. Adjust the probability threshold for classifying reviews as "positive" to optimize the balance between precision and recall.

## Reasoning
The F1-score is sensitive to changes in precision and recall, making it a crucial metric when seeking a balance between these two. Option 4 is the best strategy because it directly tackles the balance between precision and recall by adjusting the classification threshold. This adjustment can lead to an improvement in both metrics, thereby optimizing the F1-score. This option demonstrates an understanding of the relationship between precision, recall, and their impact on the F1-score, in addition to grasping the practical application of modifying a Naive Bayes classifier's behavior through threshold adjustment.
