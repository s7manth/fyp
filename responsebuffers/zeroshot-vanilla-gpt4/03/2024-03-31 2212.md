## Question
In the development of a sentiment analysis tool to analyze movie reviews, a team of data scientists opts to use a Naive Bayes classifier due to its simplicity and efficiency. The dataset contains an extensive collection of movie reviews, each labeled as 'positive' or 'negative'. After initial training, the model achieves decent accuracy but struggles with correctly classifying nuanced or mixed sentiment reviews, common in the dataset. The team decides to refine their approach by incorporating n-grams and sentiment lexicons to better capture contextual sentiment and intensifiers (e.g., "very good" versus "good"). Additionally, the team wants to assess the statistical significance of their model improvements through cross-validation.

Considering the adjustments and objectives stated above, which of the following actions best represents a comprehensive strategy to address the model's limitations and assess its performance rigorously?

1. Utilize unigrams only and perform k-fold cross-validation, using accuracy as the sole metric for evaluation.
2. Incorporate bigrams and trigrams to capture more context, apply tf-idf weighting, and evaluate the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure through 10-fold cross-validation.
3. Implement a lexicon-based approach without machine learning, relying solely on sentiment lexicons to classify reviews, and use accuracy for evaluation.
4. Use a bigram model, perform leave-one-out cross-validation, and utilize a paired t-test to compare before and after results based purely on model accuracy.
5. Expand the feature set to include unigrams, bigrams, sentiment lexicons, and perform 5-fold cross-validation; use precision, recall, F-measure, and conduct a McNemar’s test to evaluate statistical significance against the original model.

## Solution

**Step 1**: Understand the problem and requirements stated in the question. The main issue is the model’s inability to accurately classify nuanced or mixed sentiment reviews using a basic Naive Bayes classifier.

**Step 2**: The model improvement strategies mentioned involve incorporating n-grams and sentiment lexicons. N-grams (bigrams, trigrams) will help the model understand context better, while sentiment lexicons allow for a more nuanced understanding of sentiment intensity.

**Step 3**: Assessment of model improvements must be rigorous, suggesting not only a need for traditional performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F-measure) but also a statistical test to evaluate the significance of these improvements.

**Step 4**: Evaluation and selection of the correct strategy:
- **Option 1** falls short as it sticks to unigrams and does not contemplate the use of n-grams or lexicons, which are pivotal for capturing nuances.
- **Option 2** suggests using bigrams and trigrams, which can improve contextual understanding, and evaluates the model with a comprehensive set of metrics. However, it lacks mention of statistical tests to prove significance.
- **Option 3** discards the Naive Bayes model, which contradicts the requirement to refine the existing model.
- **Option 4** includes bigrams and a highly rigorous form of cross-validation but does not utilize sentiment lexicons or propose a comprehensive metric suite for evaluation.
- **Option 5** directly addresses all specified needs: expanding the feature set with n-grams and lexicons, using a sensible approach to cross-validation, assessing with a full suite of performance metrics, and evaluating improvements’ statistical significance with McNemar’s test.

Thus, **Option 5** is the most comprehensive and targeted approach to improving and evaluating the sentiment analysis model as described.

## Correct Answer

5. Expand the feature set to include unigrams, bigrams, sentiment lexicons, and perform 5-fold cross-validation; use precision, recall, F-measure, and conduct a McNemar’s test to evaluate statistical significance against the original model.

## Reasoning

The chosen approach addresses the issue of nuanced and mixed sentiment classification by enriching the feature set with both n-grams and sentiment lexicons. This strategy allows the model to better understand context and sentiment intensity—key aspects in sophisticated sentiment analysis tasks. The decision to use 5-fold cross-validation strikes a balance between computational efficiency and reliability of evaluation.

Additionally, employing a suite of evaluation metrics (precision, recall, F-measure) ensures a holistic view of model performance across different dimensions. Precision accounts for the quality of positive predictions, recall for the model's ability to capture all positive samples, and F-measure for a balanced measure of precision and recall.

Finally, conducting McNemar’s test, a statistical significance test for paired nominal data, allows for a rigorous assessment of whether the improvements made to the model are statistically significant, comparing it against its previous iteration. This is important to ensure that observed performance gains are not due to chance.
