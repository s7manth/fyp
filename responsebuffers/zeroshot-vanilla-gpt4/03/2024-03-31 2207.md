## Question
You are designing a sentiment analysis system to classify movie reviews as either positive or negative. You decide to use a Naive Bayes classifier for this task due to its simplicity and efficiency. Given the nature of language in movie reviews, which may contain sarcasm or indirect expressions of sentiment, you plan to optimize your classifier by incorporating bigrams (sequences of two consecutive words) alongside unigrams (single words) as features. You aim to evaluate your model's performance rigorously and ensure its fairness across different demographic groups. Which of the following steps would be LEAST effective in improving the accuracy and fairness of your Naive Bayes sentiment analysis system?

1. Training the Naive Bayes classifier with a balanced dataset containing an equal number of positive and negative reviews to prevent class imbalance.
2. Using a chi-square test to select the most informative unigrams and bigrams, reducing the feature space to those significantly correlated with the target classes.
3. Implementing k-fold cross-validation to assess the model's performance across multiple splits of the dataset, ensuring the evaluation is robust and less biased towards a specific partition.
4. Calculating and analyzing the Precision, Recall, and F-measure for demographic subgroups within the test data to identify and mitigate bias in the classification results.
5. Exclusively using precision-recall AUC (area under the curve) to assess the model's performance due to its insensitivity to class distribution.

## Solution

### Correct Answer
5. Exclusively using precision-recall AUC (area under the curve) to assess the model's performance due to its insensitivity to class distribution.

### Reasoning
- **Option 1** is effective as training with a balanced dataset prevents the classifier from being biased towards the more frequent class, which is a common issue in sentiment analysis where one sentiment (e.g., positive) might be overrepresented in the dataset.
  
- **Option 2** is beneficial because the chi-square test identifies features (unigrams and bigrams in this case) that are most indicative of each class. By focusing on these features, the model can become more accurate and less prone to overfitting on irrelevant features.
  
- **Option 3** describes implementing k-fold cross-validation, which is a robust method for assessing model performance. It ensures that every data point is used both for training and validation at some point, providing a comprehensive view of the model's performance and generalizability to unseen data.
  
- **Option 4** focuses on evaluating the model's fairness and accuracy by calculating precision, recall, and F-measure for different demographic subgroups. This is crucial in sentiment analysis to ensure the model does not systematically favor or disadvantage any group, addressing potential biases in the classification.
  
- **Option 5**, while precision-recall AUC is a useful metric, especially in situations with a significant imbalance between classes, relying exclusively on it could be misleading. This approach fails to account for the overall accuracy and balance between precision and recall across different thresholds. Furthermore, it does not directly address the fairness across demographic groups or consider the complexity that bigrams add to the sentiment analysis, possibly obscuring significant class distribution issues or bias in the classifier. Thus, using it as the sole evaluation metric is the least effective strategy among the listed options for improving the accuracy and fairness of a Naive Bayes sentiment analysis system.
