## Question

A research team is developing a sentiment analysis model that applies a Naive Bayes classifier for evaluating product reviews. The training data consists of labelled reviews in two categories: Positive and Negative. The team wants to optimize model precision as the top priority because the model's primary application will be filtering out highly likely negative reviews from displaying on a product page, while minimizing the rejection of positive reviews is a secondary priority.

Given the above scenario, which adjustment would most improve the modelâ€™s precision for identifying negative reviews without drastically sacrificing recall?

1. Increasing the threshold for classifying a review as Negative, even if the posterior probability is only slightly in favor of Negative.
2. Decreasing the threshold for classifying a review as Negative, requiring a higher posterior probability that favors Negative.
3. Incorporating additional positive examples into the training set to better define the boundary between Positive and Negative.
4. Utilizing bigram models instead of unigram models to capture more contextual information in the text.
5. Applying under-sampling techniques to balance the number of Positive and Negative reviews in the training set.

## Solution

### Step 1: Understanding Model Precision and Recall
- Precision measures the percentage of correctly identified instances out of all instances that were labeled by the model as belonging to a particular class.
- Recall measures the percentage of correctly identified instances out of all actual instances of that class in the test data.
- Optimizing for precision prioritizes minimizing false positives, while optimizing for recall prioritizes minimizing false negatives.

### Step 2: Analyzing the Adjustments
1. Increasing the threshold makes the model more conservative in predicting Negative, potentially lowering false positives but risking an increase in false negatives.
2. Decreasing the threshold does the opposite of what is intended as it makes the model more likely to predict Negative, increasing both true and false negatives.
3. Adding more positive examples could potentially help the model to better differentiate between Positive and Negative, but it does not directly address the optimization of precision for Negative identification.
4. Utilizing bigram models introduces context, which could help in more accurately classifying reviews and potentially increase precision by better understanding the sentiment expressed through phrases rather than individual words.
5. Balancing the dataset addresses a different issue related to model training and not precision optimization directly. While important, this is more about dealing with class imbalance rather than optimizing for one metric.

### Step 3: Selecting the Best Option
Given the goal is to improve precision for negative reviews, we need an option that makes the classifier more rigorous in its classification without significantly impacting its ability to correctly identify negative instances. Option 4 stands out as it could help understand context better, thus potentially reducing false positives (incorrectly labeled Negative reviews) without drastically reducing the true positives (correctly identified Negative reviews).

## Correct Answer

4. Utilizing bigram models instead of unigram models to capture more contextual information in the text.

## Reasoning

Utilizing bigram models can significantly contribute to understanding the sentiment expressed in the text by capturing phrases that convey meaning different from the sum of their individual words (e.g., "not bad" vs. "not" and "bad" separately). This can lead to a more accurate classification of reviews, primarily improving the precision of Negative predictions by reducing the instances where the model might misclassify a Positive review as Negative due to the lack of contextual understanding. This choice stands out as the most directly impactful method for improving precision without significantly jeopardizing recall, as it refines the model's ability to discern sentiment based on context rather than relying solely on the presence of specific words.
