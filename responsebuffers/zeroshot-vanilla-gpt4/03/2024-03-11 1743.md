## Question
You have developed a Naive Bayes sentiment analysis model to classify movie reviews into positive and negative sentiments. The model has been trained using a large dataset of labeled movie reviews, and you are now in the process of evaluating its performance. In doing so, you decide to employ precision, recall, and the F1-score as your metrics. Your initial tests reveal the following:

- Precision (Positive): 0.8
- Recall (Positive): 0.6
- Precision (Negative): 0.7
- Recall (Negative): 0.85

Concerned about the imbalance in performance between the positive and negative classes, you consider various strategies to improve your model. Which of the following approaches is most likely to improve the recall for the positive class without significantly compromising the precision for the positive class?

1. Increase the size of the training dataset by incorporating more labeled movie reviews, ensuring an equal distribution of positive and negative reviews.
2. Adjust the decision threshold for classifying reviews as positive to be more inclusive, even if it slightly increases the number of false positives.
3. Introduce bigrams and trigrams into the feature set to capture the context better, although it might increase the model's complexity.
4. Implement cross-validation to optimize the modelâ€™s hyperparameters more rigorously.
5. Apply statistical significance testing on prediction results to identify and remove outlier predictions that are potentially incorrect.

## Solution

The correct approach to improve the recall for the positive class without significantly compromising the precision for the positive class is:

2. Adjust the decision threshold for classifying reviews as positive to be more inclusive, even if it slightly increases the number of false positives.

## Correct Answer

2. Adjust the decision threshold for classifying reviews as positive to be more inclusive, even if it slightly increases the number of false positives.

## Reasoning

- **Choice 1:** Increasing the size of the training dataset by incorporating more labeled movie reviews, ensuring an equal distribution of positive and negative reviews, could improve the overall model performance by reducing bias and variance. However, it does not directly address the issue of recall for the positive class specifically. Therefore, it is not the most targeted approach for the problem described.

- **Choice 2:** Adjusting the decision threshold involves altering the probability cutoff at which the model decides whether a review is classified as positive or negative. Lowering this threshold for the positive class means that reviews are more likely to be classified as positive, thus increasing the true positive rate (recall for the positive class). This approach directly addresses the problem by making it easier for reviews to be classified as positive, aiming to increase recall without a drastic compromise in precision, provided the adjustment is modest.

- **Choice 3:** Introducing bigrams and trigrams to capture more context potentially improves the model's accuracy by understanding the nuances in sentence constructions. However, this approach increases the model's complexity and may not directly improve the recall for the positive class without affecting other metrics, like increasing the false positives, which could harm precision.

- **Choice 4:** Implementing cross-validation for hyperparameter optimization can enhance the model's overall performance but does not specifically target the improvement of recall for the positive class. Additionally, this strategy is more about model validation and generalization rather than adjusting the model's behavior towards a particular class.

- **Choice 5:** Applying statistical significance testing to identify and remove outlier predictions aims at improving the overall model accuracy but does not specifically target recall for the positive class. Outlier removal could potentially improve precision, but its impact on recall, especially for the positive class, is not direct and could potentially be minimal.

Therefore, adjusting the decision threshold (Choice 2) is the most strategic and direct approach to improving recall for the positive class without significantly harming the precision for that class, as it directly influences how classifications are made towards positive reviews.
