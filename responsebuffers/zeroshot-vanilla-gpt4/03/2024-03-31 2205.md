## Question
In an extensive natural language processing (NLP) experiment, a model based on a Naive Bayes Classifier is being developed to perform sentiment analysis on a dataset consisting of movie reviews. The dataset contains an equal number of positive and negative reviews. The experimenters utilize precision, recall, and F-measure to evaluate model performance and conduct a 10-fold cross-validation to ensure generalizability.

Given the nature of the dataset and the task, one critical aspect the researchers aim to optimize is the model's ability to minimize false positives (predicting a review is positive when it is actually negative) due to the adverse impact of incorrectly identifying negative reviews as positive on the user experience.

Which modification to the standard Naive Bayes Classifier could potentially increase the precision for the positive class without significantly affecting the recall for the negative class?

1. Increasing the prior probability of the positive class in the Naive Bayes Classifier.
2. Introducing Laplace smoothing with a higher alpha value ($\alpha > 1$) to adjust the likelihood estimates.
3. Tweaking the decision threshold used for classifying a review as positive, opting for a higher threshold.
4. Using bigrams instead of unigrams as features while training the Naive Bayes Classifier.
5. Applying undersampling to reduce the number of positive reviews in the dataset before training.

## Solution
To solve this question, we need to analyze the impact of each proposed modification on precision for the positive class and recall for the negative class in the context of a Naive Bayes Classifier used for sentiment analysis.

1. **Increasing the prior probability of the positive class** could make the classifier biased towards predicting positive reviews more often, potentially increasing both false positives and true positives, which is not the intended outcome as it might decrease precision.
  
2. **Introducing Laplace smoothing with a higher alpha value** is primarily used to handle zero probabilities for unseen events during training. Adjusting $\alpha$ affects all classes uniformly and does not specifically target precision for the positive class.

3. **Tweaking the decision threshold** affects how certain the model needs to be to classify a review as positive. A higher threshold means the model needs stronger evidence to predict a positive class, likely reducing false positives and therefore increasing precision for the positive class without directly affecting recall for the negative class, as recall is more about how well the model can identify all relevant (actual positive) instances.

4. **Using bigrams instead of unigrams** changes the feature space and might capture context better, potentially improving the overall accuracy of the model. However, it doesn't specifically target precision for the positive class over recall for the negative class.

5. **Applying undersampling** to reduce the number of positive reviews can make the training dataset unbalanced, potentially biasing the model towards predicting negative reviews, which would adversely affect recall for the positive class rather than improving precision for the positive class.

Based on the analysis, the best option to increase precision for the positive class without significantly affecting the recall for the negative class is (3) **Tweaking the decision threshold used for classifying a review as positive, opting for a higher threshold.**

## Correct Answer
3. Tweaking the decision threshold used for classifying a review as positive, opting for a higher threshold.

## Reasoning
Option 3 directly addresses the requirement to minimize false positives (improving precision) in sentiment analysis by making the classifier more conservative in predicting a review as positive. Precision is calculated as $\text{Precision} = \frac{TP}{TP + FP}$, where $TP$ is true positives and $FP$ is false positives. By increasing the decision threshold, $FP$ is likely to decrease, thus increasing the precision for the positive class. It achieves this without necessarily impacting the recall for the negative class, which is concerned with identifying all actual negative instances. Recall for the negative class is calculated as $\text{Recall} = \frac{TN}{TN + FN}$, where $TN$ is true negatives and $FN$ is false negatives, metrics that are not directly influenced by increasing the decision threshold for the positive class.
