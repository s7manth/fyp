## Question
An AI company is developing a sentiment analysis system using a Naive Bayes Classifier. They aim to optimize it for high recall to ensure that negative customer feedback is comprehensively captured for further analysis. The model is trained on a dataset comprising customer reviews, labeled as positive or negative. Given the priority for high recall in negative sentiment detection, the company decides to adjust the classification threshold. Which of the following actions regarding threshold adjustment is most likely to help achieve higher recall for detecting negative reviews, considering the typical behavior of a Naive Bayes Classifier?

1. Increasing the classification threshold for labeling a review as negative.
2. Decreasing the classification threshold for labeling a review as negative.
3. Applying the same classification threshold universally for both positive and negative classes.
4. Increasing the classification threshold for labeling a review as positive.
5. Decreasing the classification threshold for labeling a review as positive.

## Solution
To solve this question, we need an understanding of the Naive Bayes Classifier, particularly how the classification threshold affects its performance measures such as precision and recall. Recall is defined as the number of true positive results divided by the number of all relevant samples (true positives and false negatives). High recall means that an algorithm returned most of the relevant results.

For the context of sentiment analysis, especially when prioritizing the detection of negative reviews (considered as the positive class for this context), adjusting the threshold for classifying a review as negative can control the trade-off between precision and recall. Here's the impact of threshold adjustments:

- **Decreasing the classification threshold for labeling a review as negative**: This means that less evidence is needed to classify a review as negative. As a result, the model is more likely to label reviews as negative, which should increase the number of true positives (correctly identified negatives) as well as the number of false positives (positive reviews incorrectly labeled as negative). While this may reduce precision (fewer of the positively identified cases are correct), it will increase recall (more of the actual negative reviews are caught).

- **Increasing the classification threshold for labeling a review as negative**: This action would require more evidence to classify a review as negative, potentially missing some negative reviews (increasing false negatives), thus reducing recall.

- **Applying the same classification threshold universally for both positive and negative classes** doesn't specifically address the optimization for higher recall in detecting negative sentiments.

- **Increasing the classification threshold for labeling a review as positive** or **decreasing it** focuses on the positive class and does not directly address the aim of enhancing recall for the negative class.

Hence, the best action to achieve higher recall for negative sentiments detection, under the outlined scenario, is to decrease the classification threshold for labeling a review as negative.

## Correct Answer
2. Decreasing the classification threshold for labeling a review as negative.

## Reasoning
By decreasing the classification threshold for negative sentiment detection, the model requires less strong evidence to classify a review as negative. This adjustment is more likely to capture a higher proportion of genuine negative feedback (increasing the number of true positives), crucial for the given scenario where missing negative feedback could be more harmful than mistakenly classifying a positive review as negative. Although this might lead to a lower precision due to an increase in false positives, the strategy correctly aligns with the company's goal of maximizing recall for negative reviews to ensure thorough capture and analysis of customer dissatisfaction.
