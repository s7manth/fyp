## Question
Given a Naive Bayes classifier trained for sentiment analysis on a balanced dataset of movie reviews, you test it on a new set of reviews and obtain the following results: 80% precision and 70% recall for the positive class, and 90% precision and 95% recall for the negative class. Assuming the positive and negative classes are equally important for your application, you decide to calculate the F1-score for a comprehensive evaluation. Which of the following is the correct method to calculate the overall F1-score for the classifier, and what would be the score?

1. Calculate the F1-score separately for each class and then average the two scores.
2. Calculate precision and recall for the entire dataset and then use those values to calculate the F1-score.
3. Weight the F1-scores of each class by the number of samples in each class before averaging.
4. Calculate the harmonic mean of the precision and recall values for each class and report the highest.
5. None of the above accurately describes the correct method to calculate the overall F1-score.

## Solution

To find the correct solution, let's first recall the formula for the F1-score, which is the harmonic mean of precision and recall:
$$F_1 = 2 \cdot \frac{(\text{precision} \cdot \text{recall})}{(\text{precision} + \text{recall})}$$

Given that we have precision and recall values for two classes (positive and negative):

- Positive class precision (P1): 80%
- Positive class recall (R1): 70%
- Negative class precision (P2): 90%
- Negative class recall (R2): 95%

Let’s calculate the F1-score for each class first:

For the positive class:
$$F_1^{+} = 2 \cdot \frac{(0.8 \cdot 0.7)}{(0.8 + 0.7)} = 2 \cdot \frac{0.56}{1.5} \approx 0.7467$$

For the negative class:
$$F_1^{-} = 2 \cdot \frac{(0.9 \cdot 0.95)}{(0.9 + 0.95)} = 2 \cdot \frac{0.855}{1.85} \approx 0.9243$$

The question asks for the overall F1-score. The correct approach in this context, given the balanced dataset and equal importance of classes, is to average the F1-scores of both classes. Therefore, the answer would be method 1, and the overall F1-score is the average of the two class F1-scores:

$$F_1^{\text{overall}} = \frac{0.7467 + 0.9243}{2} = 0.8355$$

## Correct Answer

1. Calculate the F1-score separately for each class and then average the two scores.

## Reasoning

Option 1 is correct because, in a balanced dataset where each class is equally important, averaging the F1-scores of each class provides a straightforward and simple method to gauge the overall performance of the classifier across all classes. This method allows us to consider both the positive and negative classes equally and gives us a single metric that represents the harmonic mean of precision and recall for the classifier. The calculated F1-scores for both classes (0.7467 for positive and 0.9243 for negative), when averaged, gives an overall F1-score of 0.8355, reflecting the general effectiveness of the classifier in handling both classes. This approach is especially useful in practical situations where decision-makers need a single performance metric to evaluate the classifier’s performance comprehensively.
