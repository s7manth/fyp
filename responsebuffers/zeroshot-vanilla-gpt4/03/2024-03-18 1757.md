## Question

A research team is working on a sentiment analysis project to classify movie reviews into positive or negative categories using a Naive Bayes Classifier. To enhance the classifier's performance, they decided to incorporate bigrams (pairs of consecutive words) in addition to unigrams (single words) as features for training. After implementing this change, they noticed an unexpected decrease in the precision of their classifier when evaluated on their test set. Which of the following could be the most likely explanation for this decrease in precision?

1. The inclusion of bigrams significantly increased the number of features, causing the model to overfit the training data.
2. The use of bigrams as features led to a substantial reduction in the dataset's dimensionality, simplifying the model excessively.
3. By adding bigrams, the classifier became less sensitive to negations (e.g., "not good"), hence improving its precision.
4. The additional bigrams introduced a high degree of collinearity among the features, which Naive Bayes handles poorly.
5. The inclusion of bigrams inadvertently balanced the class distribution, making the classifier's predictions less precise.

## Solution

To solve this question, it's essential to understand how Naive Bayes Classifiers work and the impact of feature selection on their performance, especially in text classification tasks like sentiment analysis.

First, let's eliminate the unlikely options:

- **Option 2** is incorrect because the inclusion of bigrams would increase, not decrease, the dimensionality of the dataset. Naive Bayes relies on the assumption of feature independence given the class, and adding more features (like bigrams) increases the feature space.
- **Option 3** is incorrect because adding bigrams could actually improve the classifier's ability to handle negations by capturing phrases like "not good" as single features, which could potentially enhance, not decrease, precision.
- **Option 4** is a distractor. While collinearity can be an issue in some models (like linear regression), Naive Bayes inherently assumes independence among features given the class label, making this option less relevant.
- **Option 5** is incorrect because balancing the class distribution does not directly lead to a decrease in precision. If anything, a balanced class distribution could help improve model performance by preventing it from being biased toward the majority class.

This leaves us with **Option 1** as the most likely explanation. The inclusion of bigrams significantly increases the feature space since it considers pairs of consecutive words as additional features. This increase in the number of features can lead to overfitting, especially if the training data is not large enough to support the more complex model. Overfitting happens when the model learns the noise in the training data instead of the underlying pattern, resulting in poor generalization to unseen data (like the test set), which could manifest as a decrease in precision.

## Correct Answer

1. The inclusion of bigrams significantly increased the number of features, causing the model to overfit the training data.

## Reasoning

The correct reasoning hinges on understanding the effect of feature selection on the performance of Naive Bayes Classifiers, particularly in the context of text classification tasks such as sentiment analysis. Adding bigrams as features increases the dimensionality of the feature space, which can lead to overfitting if the training dataset isn't sufficiently large to support this increased complexity. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the specific details and noise in the training data to the extent that it negatively impacts its performance on new, unseen data. This results in a model that performs well on its training data but poorly on the test data, which could be observed as a decrease in precision when the model classifies new instances because it makes more false positive errors.
