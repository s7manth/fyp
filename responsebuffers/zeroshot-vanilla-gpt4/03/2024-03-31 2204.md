## Question

In a sentiment analysis task using a Naive Bayes Classifier, you are optimizing your model for a dataset composed of movie reviews. The dataset is skewed, with 70% positive reviews and 30% negative reviews. Your primary goal is to minimize the false positive rate (FPR), as falsely identifying negative reviews as positive could lead to customer dissatisfaction when they rely on your system for movie recommendations. During the optimization process, you decide to experiment with adjusting the prior probabilities and the decision threshold. Which of the following strategies is most likely to help you achieve your goal?

1. Increasing the decision threshold for classifying a review as positive.
2. Decreasing the decision threshold for classifying a review as positive.
3. Increasing the prior probability of the positive class to reflect the dataset's skewness more strongly.
4. Decreasing the prior probability of the positive class to make the model less biased towards positive reviews.
5. Keeping the decision threshold and prior probabilities at their default values, focusing instead on collecting more balanced data.

## Solution

To minimize the false positive rate (FPR) in this context, understanding the impact of decision thresholds and prior probabilities on classification outcomes is essential. The false positive rate is defined as the proportion of actual negatives (true negative reviews) that are incorrectly classified as positives (predicted as positive reviews).

1. **Increasing the decision threshold for classifying a review as positive** means that a review needs to have a stronger likelihood of being positive (according to the model's probabilities) before it is classified as such. This can effectively reduce false positives, as the model becomes more conservative in classifying reviews as positive. It helps to ensure that only reviews with a high probability of being positive are classified as positive, thus potentially reducing the number of negative reviews incorrectly labeled as positive.

2. **Decreasing the decision threshold** would have the opposite effect, making it easier for a review to be classified as positive and likely increasing the false positive rate.

3. **Increasing the prior probability of the positive class** would make the classifier more biased towards classifying reviews as positive, which is contrary to the goal of minimizing FPR.

4. **Decreasing the prior probability of the positive class** could potentially help by making the classifier less biased towards positive reviews, but this approach might not be as direct or effective as manipulating the decision threshold because it does not directly target the decision boundary between classes.

5. **Keeping the decision threshold and prior probabilities at their default values and focusing on collecting more balanced data** may eventually improve model performance, but it does not directly address the immediate goal of minimizing the false positive rate in the context of the current dataset.

Therefore, the most effective strategy among the options given for directly and immediately minimizing false positives would be to increase the decision threshold for classifying a review as positive.

## Correct Answer

1. Increasing the decision threshold for classifying a review as positive.

## Reasoning

By increasing the decision threshold, we make the Naive Bayes Classifier more conservative in classifying reviews as positive. This is a direct method to reduce the likelihood of false positives, where a negative review is misclassified as positive. The decision threshold adjustment allows the model to require stronger evidence before classifying a review as positive. This method does not rely on altering the inherent properties of the dataset (such as its skewness or balancing the data) but instead adjusts the model's classification behavior to be more stringent in identifying positive sentiments, directly addressing the goal of minimizing the false positive rate in sentiment analysis tasks.
