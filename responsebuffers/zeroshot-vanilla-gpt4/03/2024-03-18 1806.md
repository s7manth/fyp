## Question

In a natural language processing project, you are employing a Naive Bayes classifier for sentiment analysis on movie reviews. Your initial model has shown promising results but is heavily biased towards positive reviews due to the skewed nature of your dataset, which contains a larger number of positive reviews than negative ones. To address this issue and improve the overall accuracy of your classifier, you decide to implement one of the following strategies. Which of the following approaches is most likely to effectively mitigate the bias and enhance the classifier's performance?

1. Increase the size of the training dataset by adding more positive reviews to balance the ratio of positive to negative reviews.
2. Apply a cost-sensitive learning approach by assigning higher misclassification costs to positive reviews.
3. Use a feature selection technique to remove the most common words found in the positive reviews from the dataset.
4. Implement a synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) to generate synthetic negative reviews and balance the dataset.
5. Adjust the decision threshold for classifying reviews as positive to require a higher probability score.

## Solution

To solve this problem, it's important to understand the impact of dataset bias on classifier performance and the ways to address imbalance in datasets. 

1. **Increasing the size of the training dataset by adding more positive reviews** would exacerbate the existing imbalance, making the classifier even more biased towards positive reviews. This goes against the goal of mitigating bias.
   
2. **Applying a cost-sensitive learning approach** involves adjusting the classifier's learning process to penalize misclassifications of the minority class more than misclassifications of the majority class. This can help address imbalance by making the classifier more sensitive to the minority class (negative reviews in this case), but it does not directly change the distribution of the training data.

3. **Using a feature selection technique to remove the most common words found in positive reviews** might help reduce some bias towards positive sentiment features. However, this approach risks losing important information that might be crucial for accurately classifying both positive and negative reviews.

4. **Implementing SMOTE to generate synthetic negative reviews** is a technique specifically designed to address class imbalance by creating synthetic instances of the minority class. This directly tackles the issue by making the dataset more balanced, thereby helping the classifier learn a more generalizable decision boundary between positive and negative reviews.

5. **Adjusting the decision threshold for classifying reviews as positive** could help in making the classifier less biased towards positive reviews by requiring stronger evidence to classify a review as positive. However, this does not address the underlying issue of class imbalance in the training data and might lead to an increase in false negatives.

Based on these considerations, the most effective strategy for mitigating bias due to class imbalance and enhancing the classifier's performance is to implement a synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) to generate synthetic negative reviews and balance the dataset.

## Correct Answer

4. Implement a synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) to generate synthetic negative reviews and balance the dataset.

## Reasoning

The key to solving this problem lies in addressing the class imbalance issue, which is causing the classifier to be biased towards the majority class (positive reviews). While several strategies can mitigate the effects of imbalance, generating synthetic instances of the minority class (negative reviews) using SMOTE directly tackles the root cause by balancing the class distribution. This balanced dataset allows the Naive Bayes classifier to learn a more accurate and generalizable model, improving its performance on both positive and negative reviews without losing valuable information or disproportionately penalizing one class over the other.
