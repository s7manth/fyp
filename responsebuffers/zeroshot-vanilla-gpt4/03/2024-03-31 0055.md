## Question
In a sentiment analysis task using a Naive Bayes Classifier, an NLP system is optimized to distinguish between positive and negative movie reviews. After training, the system achieves an F-measure of 0.8 on the testing set. In an attempt to improve performance, an engineer proposes a series of modifications. Which of the following modifications is MOST likely to improve the system's performance by effectively addressing both the classifier's precision and recall simultaneously, considering the nuances of text data and the inherent challenges in sentiment analysis?

1. Enriching the training dataset with more positive examples to compensate for any imbalance in the distribution of classes.
2. Applying a bag of words model with TF-IDF weighting to reduce the impact of common but less informative words.
3. Adjusting the decision threshold for classification to be more conservative, thereby requiring stronger evidence before classifying a review as positive.
4. Implementing a bigram model instead of a unigram model to capture phrase-level sentiment nuances better.
5. Increasing the size of the n-gram window to five to capture more context around each word.

## Solution

To approach this question, we first need to revisit the fundamental concepts of Naive Bayes Classifier, sentiment analysis, and performance metrics like precision, recall, and F-measure. The F-measure (or F1 score) is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between them. It's crucial in scenarios where both false positives and false negatives are costly. 

1. **Adding more examples of a specific class (positive reviews)** addresses dataset imbalance, which can improve the model's ability to recognize under-represented classes. However, it primarily affects recall for the positive class and does not necessarily improve precision or the balance between precision and recall (F-measure) across both classes.

2. **Applying a bag of words model with TF-IDF weighting** helps to prioritize words that are more informative for classification by decreasing the weight of common words that appear frequently across all documents. This can enhance both precision (by reducing false positives for less informative words) and recall (by better identifying true positives with more informative cues). 

3. **Adjusting the decision threshold to be more conservative** improves precision by reducing false positives but can harm recall by increasing the number of false negatives. This approach does not improve the balance between precision and recall simultaneously.

4. **Implementing a bigram model** captures phrase-level patterns, which are highly beneficial in sentiment analysis for understanding contexts such as negations and intensifiers that significantly change sentiment. This enhancement is likely to improve both precision (by correctly identifying more nuanced positive instances) and recall (by reducing false negatives from misinterpretation of phrases), thus positively impacting the F-measure.

5. **Increasing the size of the n-gram window to five** might capture more context but can also introduce noise and sparsity in the feature space, making it harder for the classifier to learn effectively. This does not necessarily improve precision and recall in a balanced way and could even deteriorate performance due to overfitting.

Among the options, **implementing a bigram model instead of a unigram model** stands out as the most effective strategy for improving both precision and recall in sentiment analysis. It addresses the nuanced understanding of language required for correctly classifying sentiments, especially where the sentiment is dependent on the combination of words rather than individual words.

## Correct Answer

4. Implementing a bigram model instead of a unigram model to capture phrase-level sentiment nuances better.

## Reasoning

The reasoning behind selecting option 4 lies in the nature of sentiment analysis tasks, where the sentiment often hinges on word combinations (e.g., "not good" vs. "good"). A bigram model, by considering pairs of consecutive words as features, captures these critical nuances better than a unigram model, which only considers individual words independently. This additional context enables more accurate classifications leading to improvements in both precision (the system's ability to only classify genuinely positive or genuinely negative reviews correctly) and recall (the system's ability to find all relevant instances of each sentiment category). Thus, while all options have their merits, the introduction of a bigram model directly targets the need for nuanced understanding in sentiment analysis, making it the most effective choice for enhancing the classifier's overall performance as measured by the F-measure.
