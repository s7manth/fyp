## Question

A data science team is optimizing a Naive Bayes classifier for a sentiment analysis task on social media texts. Their initial model exhibits high precision but significantly lower recall, indicating that it misses a large fraction of positive instances. The team proposes several strategies to improve the model's performance. Which of the following strategies is most likely to effectively increase recall without drastically reducing precision?

1. Increase the laplace smoothing parameter ($\lambda$) to reduce the impact of rare words.
2. Decrease the threshold for classifying a text as positive sentiment.
3. Use a more complex model such as a deep learning approach to capture nuanced language features.
4. Exclude stopwords from the model to reduce noise and focus on content-rich words.
5. Integrate an external, larger dataset to retrain the model, ensuring that the dataset has a balanced distribution of sentiment classes.

## Solution

To effectively increase recall without drastically reducing precision in a Naive Bayes classifier for sentiment analysis, we should understand the impact of each proposed strategy:

1. **Increasing the Laplace smoothing parameter ($\lambda$)** helps in handling rare words by ensuring that no word has a zero probability. While it can make the model more robust, it may not directly improve recall for positive instances specifically, as it affects all classes uniformly.

2. **Decreasing the threshold for classifying a text as positive sentiment** directly addresses the problem of low recall. Recall is defined as the number of true positive results divided by the number of all relevant samples (all samples that should have been identified as positive). Lowering the threshold means that the model will classify more texts as positive, potentially increasing the number of true positives and, hence, the recall. However, this could slightly affect precision, but the trade-off is often necessary to balance the two metrics.

3. **Using a more complex model such as deep learning** might capture more nuanced language features, potentially increasing overall accuracy. However, this does not specifically address the immediate concern of improving recall in a Naive Bayes context and might introduce more complexity than necessary at this stage.

4. **Excluding stopwords from the model** might help focus the classifier on more meaningful words, but this approach usually leads to marginal gains. In sentiment analysis, the presence or absence of certain stopwords can sometimes contribute to sentiment, so this might not necessarily increase recall for positive sentiments.

5. **Integrating an external, larger dataset to retrain the model**, ensuring a balanced distribution of sentiment classes, can indeed help in improving the model’s understanding and representation of each class. However, this doesn’t directly target the issue of improving recall while maintaining precision. It might improve the model overall but doesn’t specifically address the low recall problem.

Based on the analysis, the most effective strategy targeting an increase in recall without drastically affecting precision would be to decrease the threshold for classifying a text as positive sentiment.

## Correct Answer

2. Decrease the threshold for classifying a text as positive sentiment.

## Reasoning

Decreasing the threshold for positive sentiment classification directly impacts recall, as it allows the model to classify more instances as positive. This increment in positive classifications is likely to capture more true positives, which are instances that should have been classified as positive but weren't due to the model's conservative threshold. This approach directly targets the issue of the model missing a large fraction of positive instances, thereby increasing recall. While this could lead to a minor decrease in precision since some negative instances may now be misclassified as positive, this strategy represents a targeted trade-off designed to improve recall specifically in the context of a Naive Bayes classifier used for sentiment analysis.
