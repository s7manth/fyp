## Question

A research team is investigating the feasibility of using a Naive Bayes classifier for sentiment analysis on product reviews. The dataset consists of thousands of product reviews, each labeled either as positive or negative. Given the uneven distribution of reviews, with significantly more positive than negative reviews, the team is concerned about the classifier's performance, especially in correctly identifying negative reviews. In this context, which of the following modifications or strategies could most effectively address the team's concern about the classifier's potential bias towards positive reviews?

1. Implement a bag-of-words model with term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) weighting to enhance the feature representation.
2. Use oversampling techniques to increase the number of negative reviews in the training set to match the number of positive reviews.
3. Apply dimensionality reduction techniques, like Principal Component Analysis (PCA), on the feature set to improve computational efficiency.
4. Modify the Naive Bayes classifier to incorporate bigrams and trigrams, increasing the context captured in the feature set.
5. Adjust the decision boundary of the Naive Bayes classifier by calibrating the posterior probabilities using a holdout validation set.

## Solution

Step 1: Understand the problem concerning the bias toward positive reviews due to an imbalanced dataset.
Step 2: Review potential strategies that can address imbalanced datasets and improve classifier performance, focusing on sensitivity toward the minority class (negative reviews).
Step 3: Evaluate each option:
- Option 1 (TF-IDF) improves feature representation but does not directly address imbalance.
- Option 2 (Oversampling) targets the problem directly by balancing the classes, hence improving the classifier's ability to learn from the underrepresented class.
- Option 3 (PCA) is aimed at computational efficiency and may not directly affect the classifier's bias towards the majority class.
- Option 4 (Incorporating n-grams) enhances context representation but does not deal with the imbalance issue.
- Option 5 (Calibrating posterior probabilities) may help in adjusting the decision threshold but does not address the root cause, which is the imbalanced training data.

Based on these considerations, Option 2 is the most effective strategy specifically designed to address the issue of class imbalance by making the classes more balanced.

## Correct Answer

2. Use oversampling techniques to increase the number of negative reviews in the training set to match the number of positive reviews.

## Reasoning

The major issue highlighted is the classifierâ€™s potential bias toward the more frequent class (positive reviews) due to the imbalanced nature of the dataset. This imbalance can lead to poor performance in identifying negative reviews, which are the minority class. Oversampling techniques, such as Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE), can mitigate this problem by increasing the representation of the minority class (negative reviews) in the training data. By creating synthetic examples or duplicating existing negative reviews, the training dataset becomes more balanced, allowing the Naive Bayes classifier to learn a more representative decision boundary between positive and negative reviews. This approach directly addresses the concern of classifier bias towards the more abundant class by modifying the dataset's composition, hence improving the classifier's ability to accurately identify reviews from both classes.
