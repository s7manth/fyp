## Question
In the context of using a Naive Bayes classifier for sentiment analysis of movie reviews, an NLP practitioner notes a significant disparity in the classifier's performance across different demographic groups, suggesting a bias in the model's predictions. The model was trained on a large, seemingly diverse dataset of movie reviews from a popular online database. To identify and mitigate this bias, the practitioner considers a range of strategies. Which of the following approaches is LEAST likely to effectively address the issue of bias in the model's predictions?

1. Augmenting the training dataset with more representative samples across different demographic groups to ensure the model learns from a more balanced and diverse distribution of data.
2. Employing a model interpretability tool to identify which features the model is using to make its predictions and manually remove biased or sensitive features related to demographic information.
3. Conducting an error analysis to identify the types of errors the model is making across different demographic groups and adjusting the model or data accordingly.
4. Implementing a technique that adjusts the model's predictions to enhance fairness, such as equalizing false positive rates across different demographic groups.
5. Utilizing a different machine learning algorithm, such as a deep neural network, under the assumption that a more complex model would inherently be less biased.

## Solution
To address the bias in the Naive Bayes classifier's predictions effectively, it is critical to understand the source of bias and the most appropriate strategies for mitigation. The options provide a variety of strategies, each with different focuses and potential impacts on bias:

1. **Augmenting the training dataset** can effectively reduce bias by ensuring that the model is exposed to a more balanced representation of data, thereby learning to make predictions that are more equitable across different demographic groups.
2. **Employing a model interpretability tool** to remove biased features is a direct attempt to eliminate the influence of explicit demographic information or other features that may lead to biased predictions. This can help in understanding the model’s decision-making process and identifying problematic features.
3. **Conducting an error analysis** for different demographic groups can reveal specific weaknesses in the model's performance, allowing targeted improvements to the model or training data to address these issues.
4. **Adjusting the model's predictions** to enforce fairness criteria, such as demographic parity or equal opportunity, can directly tackle disparity in model outcomes. Techniques like re-weighting or post-hoc adjustments are practical examples of this approach.
5. **Switching to a different machine learning algorithm**, such as a deep neural network, without addressing the underlying data or feature issues, is unlikely to inherently reduce the model's bias. Complex models can still propagate or even amplify biases present in the training data if not carefully designed and trained with fairness in mind.

## Correct Answer
5. Utilizing a different machine learning algorithm, such as a deep neural network, under the assumption that a more complex model would inherently be less biased.

## Reasoning
The effectiveness of addressing bias in a Naive Bayes classifier's predictions hinges on directly handling the sources of bias—namely, biased data samples, biased features, or biased decision boundaries. Strategies 1-4 focus on these aspects by either improving the diversity of the dataset, removing or adjusting biased features, understanding model errors in the context of demographic groups, or intentionally modifying the model's decision criteria for fairness.

Option 5, however, assumes that merely switching to a more complex model (like a deep neural network) would inherently mitigate bias, which is a misconception. Without specifically addressing the factors contributing to bias (e.g., skewed training data, biased feature selection), more complex models can still learn and perpetuate the biases present in the data. In fact, due to their higher capacity for learning intricate patterns, deep neural networks might more effectively capture and amplify biases if not properly regulated, making this approach the least effective for addressing bias in predictions.
