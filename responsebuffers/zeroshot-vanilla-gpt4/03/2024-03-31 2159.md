## Question
In a sentiment analysis task using a Naive Bayes Classifier, you are confronted with a highly imbalanced dataset where 90% of the instances are positive reviews. After training your classifier, you notice that it exhibits a high accuracy of 92% but performs poorly in identifying negative reviews. In an attempt to address this issue, you consider various strategies to improve the performance of your Naive Bayes Classifier specifically for the negative reviews while maintaining overall performance. Which of the following approaches is least likely to improve the classifier's ability to correctly identify negative reviews?

1. Applying oversampling techniques to increase the number of negative review instances in the training set.
2. Utilizing under-sampling to decrease the number of positive review instances in the training set.
3. Implementing cost-sensitive learning by assigning higher misclassification costs to negative reviews.
4. Incorporating synonym replacement to augment the data for negative reviews artificially.
5. Increasing the prior probability of the positive class to reflect its higher frequency in the dataset.

## Solution

### Correct Answer
5. Increasing the prior probability of the positive class to reflect its higher frequency in the dataset.

### Reasoning
To address the poor performance in identifying negative reviews within an imbalanced dataset, it's essential to understand the impact of different strategies on a Naive Bayes Classifier:

1. **Applying oversampling techniques** to increase the number of negative review instances can help balance the dataset, providing the classifier with more examples of the minority class. This can improve its ability to recognize patterns associated with negative reviews.

2. **Utilizing under-sampling** to decrease the number of positive review instances can also help in balancing the dataset, although it may lead to losing some information from the majority class. However, this method aims at improving the detection of negative reviews by reducing the dominance of the positive instances.

3. **Implementing cost-sensitive learning** by assigning higher misclassification costs to negative reviews directly addresses the classifier's focus, encouraging it to better classify negative reviews to avoid higher penalties for misclassifying them.

4. **Incorporating synonym replacement** to augment the data specifically for negative reviews could improve the model's understanding and detection of negative sentiment by introducing a wider range of vocabulary associated with negative sentiment, without significantly altering the class distribution.

5. **Increasing the prior probability of the positive class** would actually worsen the problem of classifier bias towards positive reviews. Since the classifier's poor performance in identifying negative reviews is the issue, making the model even more biased towards the positive class (which it already identifies well) does not help in improving the detection of negative reviews. Instead, it reinforces the model's existing bias towards the class that is overly represented in the dataset, thus being the least effective strategy among the options provided.
