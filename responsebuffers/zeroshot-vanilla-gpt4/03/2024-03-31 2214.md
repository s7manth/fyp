## Question
In a study for sentiment analysis using Naive Bayes Classifier, a researcher decides to use a variant of the model that accounts for word order by incorporating bigrams in addition to unigrams. The primary dataset for the study consists of movie reviews, which have been labeled as either positive or negative. Apart from enhancing the model's vocabulary with bigrams, the researcher also applies smoothing techniques to address the issue of zero probabilities. However, they notice an unexpected drop in accuracy on the test set post-adjustment. Which of the following explanations could most plausibly account for this observation?

1. The addition of bigrams significantly reduced the model's bias by capturing more contextual information, thus improving its generalizability and accuracy on unseen data.
2. By incorporating bigrams, the model's feature space increased exponentially, leading to sparsity issues that the smoothing technique failed to adequately address, causing overfitting and a subsequent drop in performance on the test data.
3. The smoothing technique used was too aggressive, resulting in the underweighting of informative unigrams and bigrams, which diminished the model's ability to distinguish between positive and negative sentiments accurately.
4. Incorporating bigrams increased the computational complexity of the model but had negligible impact on its accuracy since most sentiment-carrying phrases in movie reviews are longer than two words and thus not adequately captured by bigrams.
5. The dataset was inherently biased towards more complex sentence structures that are not adequately represented by either unigrams or bigrams, making the model's predictions less reliable irrespective of the smoothing technique applied.

## Solution

The correct explanation for the observed drop in accuracy after incorporating bigrams and applying smoothing techniques would involve understanding the impact of these changes on the model's behavior.

1. **Increasing the Feature Space with Bigrams:** By incorporating bigrams, the feature space of the model increases significantly. Bigrams allow the model to capture more contextual information compared to unigrams alone, potentially increasing its capacity to understand and classify sentiments accurately. However, this also makes the model more complex and prone to overfitting, particularly if the feature space becomes too sparse because many bigrams might only appear a few times across the training data.

2. **Sparsity Issues:** The significant increase in the feature space due to bigrams can lead to sparsity issues. This happens when the model encounters many features (i.e., bigrams) with very low occurrence across the dataset, making it difficult for the model to learn effectively from these features. Smoothing techniques are applied to mitigate this problem by adjusting the probability estimates so that no event has a zero probability. However, if the feature space is overwhelmingly sparse, smoothing might not be sufficient to address the underlying issue.

3. **Overfitting and Generalization:** Overfitting occurs when a model learns the details and noise in the training data to the extent that it negatively impacts the model's performance on new data. A model with a vast and sparse feature space, like the one expanded by bigrams, can easily overfit to the training data, especially if not all the introduced features (bigrams) are equally informative about the sentiment.

Hence, considering these points and the options provided:

## Correct Answer
2. By incorporating bigrams, the model's feature space increased exponentially, leading to sparsity issues that the smoothing technique failed to adequately address, causing overfitting and a subsequent drop in performance on the test data.

## Reasoning
The correct answer is option 2 because it directly addresses the complications introduced by enlarging the feature space with bigrams. This addition makes the model's learning process more challenging due to the increased sparsity of the features. While smoothing techniques are designed to mitigate the issue of zero probabilities for unseen features, they might not efficiently solve the sparsity problem, especially when the feature space becomes excessively large due to the inclusion of bigrams. This can lead to overfitting, where the model performs well on the training data but poorly on unseen test data. The other options either incorrectly specify the outcome of adding bigrams and smoothing (options 1, 3, 4, and 5) or do not effectively link the changes made to the observed drop in performance on the test set.
