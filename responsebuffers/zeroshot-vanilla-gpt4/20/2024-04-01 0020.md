## Question

A research team is developing a coreference resolution system designed to perform well on Winograd Schema problems, partially addressing issues of gender bias in pronoun resolution. Their approach combines mention detection, entity linking, and a neural mention-ranking algorithm. Given a sentence from the Winograd Schema Challenge, "The trophy doesn’t fit in the brown suitcase because it’s too big. What does 'it' refer to?", the system must accurately determine that 'it' refers to 'the trophy' and not 'the brown suitcase'. 

To improve the system's performance on such tasks, the team considers integrating external knowledge sources. Which of the following external sources would MOST likely improve the system’s ability to tackle the ambiguity present in Winograd Schema problems and reduce gender bias in coreference resolution?

1. A large corpus of annotated coreference resolution datasets with balanced representations of different gender pronouns.
2. A database of common sense knowledge containing relationships between physical objects and their attributes.
3. Pretrained word embeddings generated from large-scale web corpora without any debiasing process applied.
4. A fine-tuned BERT model on a dataset of Wikipedia articles for enhancing linguistic contextual understanding.
5. A real-time web scraping tool for gathering contemporary use cases of pronouns in various contexts and demographics.

## Solution

To address the specific challenge presented by Winograd Schema problems and to mitigate gender bias in coreference resolution, the integration of an external knowledge source that provides additional context or commonsense understanding would be most beneficial. Winograd Schema problems often hinge on subtleties of world knowledge or common sense that are not readily captured through linguistic analysis alone or through datasets that focus narrowly on linguistic representations. 

1. While **Option 1**, a large corpus with balanced gender pronoun representations, can help mitigate gender bias by providing diverse examples, it may not directly augment the system's ability to understand the context or common sense reasoning required to resolve ambiguities in Winograd schemas.
2. **Option 2**, a database of common sense knowledge, directly addresses the need for external world knowledge about the relationships between physical objects and their attributes. This database can provide crucial information for determining which noun a pronoun refers to based on the physical or logical properties mentioned in the sentence.
3. **Option 3**, pretrained word embeddings from unprocessed web corpora, might introduce or perpetuate existing biases and lacks the specific common sense or contextual knowledge necessary for solving Winograd Schema problems.
4. A fine-tuned BERT model (**Option 4**) enhances linguistic contextual understanding but may still fall short in specific instances where external common sense knowledge, not present in the text, is required to resolve ambiguity.
5. **Option 5**, a real-time web scraping tool, provides contemporary linguistic uses but lacks the structured knowledge about object attributes and their interrelations critical for solving Winograd Schemas.

Therefore, a database of common sense knowledge (**Option 2**) stands out as the most directly relevant and likely to improve system performance on Winograd Schema challenges by providing the essential external knowledge base for interpreting complex scenarios and reducing bias through broader context understanding rather than purely linguistic patterns.

## Correct Answer

2. A database of common sense knowledge containing relationships between physical objects and their attributes.

## Reasoning

Winograd Schema problems necessitate the understanding of nuanced, often implicit, common sense knowledge about the physical world and the interaction between its objects. This requirement goes beyond linguistic and syntactic analysis or general contextual understanding provided by current NLP models and datasets. The ability to access an external database containing structured common sense knowledge about objects and their attributes allows for reasoning that mimics human cognition more closely. Specifically, in the given example, understanding that trophies, unlike suitcases, can be characterized by a size that might prevent them from fitting inside suitcases, requires exactly the type of knowledge that a common sense database provides. Such an approach not only addresses the ambiguity inherent in Winograd Schema problems but also offers a path to mitigate gender bias by focusing on attributes and relationships rather than gendered assumptions.
