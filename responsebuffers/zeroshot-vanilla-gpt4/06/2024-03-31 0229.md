## Question
Consider a scenario where you are working on a neural language model aimed at predicting the next word in a sentence. You decide to use a feedforward neural network (FNN) with a single hidden layer for this task and train it using backpropagation. You initialize the weights of your network randomly and choose a sigmoid activation function for the hidden layer. After training, however, you observe that the model performs poorly on both training and validation datasets.

Which of the following adjustments is MOST likely to improve the model's performance?

1. Increase the number of epochs for training, keeping the learning rate constant.
2. Replace the sigmoid activation function with a rectified linear unit (ReLU) for the hidden layer.
3. Reduce the learning rate by a factor of ten without changing the training epochs.
4. Increase the size of the hidden layer by adding more neurons, without changing the activation function.
5. Replace the feedforward neural network with a simple linear regression model.

## Solution

Upon observing poor performance in both training and validation datasets, we must diagnose whether the problem arises from high bias (underfitting) or high variance (overfitting).

1. **Increasing the number of epochs**: This approach might help if the model has not converged yet, but it might also risk overfitting if the model is already overfitting or bias is the root cause (unlikely effective in isolation).
2. **Replacing the sigmoid with ReLU**: Sigmoid functions can suffer from vanishing gradient issues, especially in deep networks or networks with many neurons in the hidden layer. ReLU, being non-saturating, can help in faster convergence and alleviate the vanishing gradient problem, making learning more effective (likely effective).
3. **Reducing the learning rate**: If the learning rate is too high, the model might overshoot minima. However, reducing the learning rate without adjusting epochs could merely slow down training, and without evidence of overshooting, this may not address the core issue (unlikely effective in isolation).
4. **Increasing the size of the hidden layer**: Adding more neurons can increase the model's capacity, allowing it to learn more complex representations. However, this also carries the risk of overfitting if not complemented with regularization or more data (potentially effective but with caveats).
5. **Replacing the model with linear regression**: Given the task is predictive modeling of language, a task known for its complexity and non-linearity, a linear model is unlikely to outperform a neural network on such a problem (unlikely effective).

Given these considerations, the most promising approach to address the described issue effectively is **option 2**, replacing the sigmoid activation function with ReLU. This change targets a known limitation (vanishing gradients) without unnecessarily increasing model complexity or risking overfitting.

## Correct Answer

2. Replace the sigmoid activation function with a rectified linear unit (ReLU) for the hidden layer.

## Reasoning

The motivation behind choosing option 2 is rooted in addressing the limitations of the sigmoid activation function, particularly its susceptibility to the vanishing gradient problem. In practice, gradients can become very small, effectively halting the network from further training or making it very slow. This is particularly problematic in networks that need to learn complex functions, such as language models.

The ReLU activation function alleviates the vanishing gradient problem since its gradient is constant (and not vanishing) for all positive inputs, which leads to faster convergence. Additionally, ReLU is computationally simpler to implement than the sigmoid since it involves simple thresholding at zero.

This change directly addresses an underlying issue that could be impeding learning in the neural language model, namely, inadequate adjustment of weights during training due to vanishing gradients. By switching to ReLU, the network can more effectively learn from the data, likely improving performance on the training and validation datasets without exacerbating overfitting or significantly increasing the model's complexity.
