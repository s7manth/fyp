## Question

In the context of natural language processing (NLP) using neural networks, the XOR problem is a classic example used to demonstrate the limitations of simple perceptrons and the capabilities of multi-layer architectures. Suppose you are designing a feedforward neural network (FNN) with a single hidden layer to solve the XOR problem, where the inputs and outputs of the XOR function are as follows:

- Input: (0,0), Output: 0
- Input: (0,1), Output: 1
- Input: (1,0), Output: 1
- Input: (1,1), Output: 0

Considering this scenario, which of the following statements correctly describes the architecture and training requirements needed to solve the XOR problem with your network?

1. A single-layer FNN with two neurons in the input layer and one neuron in the output layer suffices, as the XOR function is linearly separable.
2. A two-layer FNN with two neurons in the input layer, two neurons in the hidden layer, and one neuron in the output layer with linear activation functions can model the XOR function.
3. A two-layer FNN with two neurons in the input layer, at least two neurons in the hidden layer, and one neuron in the output layer, utilizing non-linear activation functions, is required to accurately model the XOR function.
4. A multi-layer FNN with three hidden layers, utilizing non-linear activation functions in each layer except for the output layer which should use a linear function, is the minimum requirement for solving the XOR problem.
5. A single-layer FNN utilizing a sophisticated non-linear activation function in the output neuron can learn the XOR function without additional hidden layers.

## Solution

To solve the XOR problem using a feedforward neural network, we need to recall what the XOR function entails and why it represents a limitation for simple, single-layer perceptrons.

The XOR function outputs 1 only when the inputs are different (i.e., (0,1) or (1,0)) and outputs 0 when the inputs are the same (i.e., (0,0) or (1,1)). This pattern cannot be separated by a single, straight line in the input space, meaning the function is not linearly separable.

A single-layer perceptron (which is essentially what choice 1 describes) can only solve problems that are linearly separable, which the XOR function is not. Thus, the first choice is incorrect.

Choice 2 suggests a two-layer architecture with linear activation functions. However, linear functions, regardless of how they are composed in layers, ultimately collapse into a single linear function during computation. Since XOR is not linearly separable, using linear activation functions cannot solve the problem. Hence, the second choice is incorrect.

Choice 3 correctly states that a feedforward neural network with at least one hidden layer and non-linear activation functions can model the XOR function. By using non-linear activations, such as sigmoid or ReLU functions, the network can learn non-linear separations in the input space, allowing it to solve the XOR problem correctly.

Choice 4 suggests an overly complex model. While a multi-layer FNN with non-linear activation functions can indeed solve the XOR problem, it is not the minimum requirement. The XOR problem can be solved with just a single hidden layer if non-linear activation functions are used. Therefore, choice 4 is not the most efficient answer.

Choice 5 proposes using a single-layer FNN with a non-linear activation function. However, as mentioned, a single-layer perceptron, no matter the sophistication of the activation function at the output, cannot solve problems that are not linearly separable. Therefore, choice 5 is incorrect.

## Correct Answer

3. A two-layer FNN with two neurons in the input layer, at least two neurons in the hidden layer, and one neuron in the output layer, utilizing non-linear activation functions, is required to accurately model the XOR function.

## Reasoning

The XOR problem is a classic example that illustrates the need for neural networks to incorporate hidden layers and non-linear activation functions to solve non-linearly separable problems. The correct notion is that a feedforward neural network must have at least one hidden layer with non-linear activation functions to capture the XOR pattern. This structure allows the network to create a non-linear decision boundary that can separate the inputs based on their respective outputs correctly. The explanation clarifies how different combinations of linear and non-linear architectures impact the network's ability to solve specific types of problems, with a focus on the non-linearity introduced by the XOR problem.
