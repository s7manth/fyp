## Question
Given a task to develop a language model that predicts the next word in a sequence, you decide to use a Feed Forward Neural Network due to its simplicity and speed for a proof-of-concept. You understand that the XOR problem historically illustrated the limitations of Perceptrons and emphasized the need for multi-layer architectures and non-linear activation functions in neural networks to solve non-linearly separable problems. Keeping the XOR problem's historical significance and the characteristics of neural networks in mind, which of the following design choices for your language model would likely avoid the inadequacies that perceptrons faced with the XOR problem?

1. Using a single-layer neural network with linear activation functions
2. Employing a deep neural network architecture with sigmoid activation functions in hidden layers and softmax in the output layer
3. Avoiding the use of non-linear activation functions to keep the model interpretation simple
4. Utilizing a shallow neural network with a large number of neurons in the single hidden layer and linear activation functions
5. Implementing a multi-layer architecture but exclusively using ReLU activation functions in all layers, including the output layer

## Solution
### Correct Answer
2. Employing a deep neural network architecture with sigmoid activation functions in hidden layers and softmax in the output layer

### Reasoning
To address this question, it’s important to recall the XOR problem and its implications for neural network design. The XOR problem highlighted the limitations of Perceptrons (single-layer neural networks with linear activation functions), demonstrating that linear classifiers are incapable of solving problems that are not linearly separable. 

The language prediction task involves predicting the next word in a sequence, a problem that is inherently complex and likely involves non-linear relationships between input features (word embeddings, context, etc.). To model these complex relationships, the neural network should have the following capabilities:
- **Non-linearity**: To capture the non-linear relationships, which single-layer perceptrons or linear activation functions cannot.
- **Depth**: Multiple layers allow for the abstraction and composition of features from raw input up to higher-order semantic concepts, which are essential in language modeling.
- **Appropriate Output Activation**: For a classification task like word prediction, softmax is necessary at the output layer to represent the probability distribution over a potentially large vocabulary.

Hence, option 2, "Employing a deep neural network architecture with sigmoid activation functions in hidden layers and softmax in the output layer,” meets all these essential criteria:
- **Sigmoid activation functions**: Introduce necessary non-linearity, allowing the network to learn complex patterns.
- **Deep architecture**: Provides the depth required for abstraction and representation of complex features in language.
- **Softmax in the output layer**: Appropriately models the output for a multi-class classification problem like predicting the next word in a sequence.

The other options are inadequate for the following reasons:
- **1 & 4**: Single-layer networks or linear activation functions cannot model the complex, non-linear relationships inherent in language.
- **3**: Non-linearity is crucial for modeling complex patterns, thus avoiding it would be detrimental.
- **5**: While ReLU is an excellent function for introducing non-linearity and avoiding vanishing gradient problems, using ReLU in the output layer for a multi-class classification is not appropriate. The output layer should use softmax to represent probabilities.
