## Question

Consider the task of enhancing a Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) for Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications, specifically focusing on language modeling. You've experimented with various architectures and have observed varying performance levels across them. Given this scenario, which of the following modifications is MOST likely to improve the network's capacity for language modeling, particularly in capturing long-range dependencies in the text?

1. Increasing the depth of the network by adding more hidden layers
2. Transitioning from ReLU to sigmoid activation functions in all layers
3. Reducing the size of the input embedding layer
4. Implementing a dropout technique on the final output layer
5. Switching from a dense feedforward architecture to a recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture

## Solution

To solve this question, the student needs to understand the fundamentals and limitations of Feedforward Neural Networks in NLP applications, specifically language modeling, and how various architectural and methodological changes can impact performance.

1. **Increasing the depth of the network by adding more hidden layers** - This can indeed improve the network's capacity to learn more complex features and relationships in the data. However, FNNs, regardless of depth, inherently struggle with capturing sequential and long-range dependencies due to their feedforward nature and lack of memory.

2. **Transitioning from ReLU to sigmoid activation functions in all layers** - Sigmoid activation functions can lead to problems like vanishing gradients, especially in deep networks, making it harder to learn. ReLU is generally preferred for its ability to maintain gradient flow in deep networks.

3. **Reducing the size of the input embedding layer** - This could potentially degrade performance by limiting the representation space of words or tokens, making it difficult for the network to encapsulate semantic nuances.

4. **Implementing a dropout technique on the final output layer** - While dropout is a powerful regularization technique to prevent overfitting by randomly dropping units from the network during training, applying it solely on the final output layer may not be the most impactful modification for enhancing language modeling capabilities.

5. **Switching from a dense feedforward architecture to a recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture** - RNNs are specifically designed to handle sequence data, allowing them to capture temporal dynamics and long-range dependencies, which FNNs lack. This characteristic makes RNNs more suited for tasks like language modeling, where understanding the sequential nature of language and its context is crucial.

## Correct Answer

5. Switching from a dense feedforward architecture to a recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture

## Reasoning

While all the options provided could influence the performance of a neural network in various tasks, the specific question of enhancing an FNN for language modeling, particularly for capturing long-range dependencies, is best addressed by switching the architecture to one that inherently handles sequential data. FNNs process inputs in a feedforward manner without regard for their sequence, limiting their ability to model language effectively, especially for longer ranges of text. RNNs, by design, can process sequences of data, making use of their internal state (memory) to capture information about what has been processed so far - thereby inherently better at capturing long-range dependencies in text. This is why option 5 is the most appropriate modification for the described scenario.
