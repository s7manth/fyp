## Question
Consider you are developing a feedforward neural network (FNN) for a natural language processing (NLP) task that involves sentiment analysis of movie reviews. Each movie review is represented as a sequence of word embeddings, and you aim to classify these reviews into positive or negative sentiments. Given the importance of both local (specific words or phrases) and global (overall sentence structure and context) semantics in determining sentiment, you decide to incorporate these considerations into the architecture and training process of your neural network.

Which of the following approaches best addresses the need to capture both local and global semantic information in the sentiment analysis task?

1. Train a shallow FNN with a single hidden layer, focusing on optimizing word embeddings during the training process to capture local semantics effectively.
2. Implement an FNN with multiple hidden layers, where early layers specialize in recognizing local semantic patterns (specific words/phrases) and deeper layers capture global semantic structures (entire sentence context).
3. Utilize a recurrent neural network (RNN) instead of an FNN, since FNNs cannot capture sequential information inherent in text data effectively.
4. Incorporate a convolutional neural network (CNN) layer before the FNN layers to exploit locality and translation invariance properties for capturing local semantics, followed by FNN layers for global semantics.
5. Combine all word embeddings into a single, fixed-size vector through averaging before feeding them into a deep FNN, to ensure that global context is preserved while simplifying the model architecture.

## Solution

The correct answer is:

**2. Implement an FNN with multiple hidden layers, where early layers specialize in recognizing local semantic patterns (specific words/phrases) and deeper layers capture global semantic structures (entire sentence context).**

## Correct Answer

2. Implement an FNN with multiple hidden layers, where early layers specialize in recognizing local semantic patterns (specific words/phrases) and deeper layers capture global semantic structures (entire sentence context).

## Reasoning

To arrive at this conclusion, we can evaluate each proposed approach in terms of its ability to capture both local and global semantics in text:

1. **Shallow FNN with a single hidden layer focusing on word embeddings:** While optimizing word embeddings is crucial for capturing semantic meaning at the word level, a single hidden layer in an FNN may not be sufficient to capture complex sentence-level structures or the interaction between different parts of the text, which are important for understanding overall sentiment.

2. **FNN with multiple hidden layers for local and global semantics:** This approach takes advantage of the hierarchical nature of neural networks. In deep architectures, lower layers can learn to recognize simple patterns (such as specific sentiment-indicative words or phrases), while higher layers can combine these patterns to understand more complex structures (like the overall sentiment of a sentence). This hierarchical learning process effectively captures both local and global semantic information.

3. **Using an RNN instead of an FNN:** While RNNs are indeed well-suited for sequential data like text due to their ability to maintain information about the sequence, the question specifically involves the development of an FNN for the task. Moreover, RNNs alone do not inherently prioritize the distinction between local and global semantics without specific architectural adjustments or additional mechanisms like attention.

4. **Incorporating a CNN layer before FNN layers:** CNNs are effective at capturing local dependencies and patterns (such as phrases or n-grams in text) due to their convolutional filters and locality properties. Adding a CNN layer can indeed help with local semantics, but this approach may not be as straightforward in focusing on hierarchical learning of global sentence semantics within the subsequent FNN layers.

5. **Averaging word embeddings before a deep FNN:** This method reduces all input text to a single aggregation of word embeddings, which can dilute individual word significance and sequential information critical for sentiment analysis. While it simplifies the model, it risks losing valuable local context and nuances essential for accurate sentiment classification.

Therefore, option 2 is the most appropriate, as it explicitly addresses the need to capture both the detailed local semantics found at the word or phrase level and the broader global semantics necessary for understanding overall sentiment.
