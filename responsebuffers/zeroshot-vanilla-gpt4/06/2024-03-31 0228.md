## Question
The XOR problem is a classical example used to explain the nonlinear capabilities of neural networks. Considering a feed-forward neural network (FNN) with a single hidden layer designed to solve the XOR problem, where the input layer has two nodes (for the two binary inputs of the XOR function), and the output layer has one node (for the binary output), which of the following configurations *correctly* describes an FNN that can successfully learn and predict the XOR function?

1. Two nodes in the hidden layer, using a linear activation function.
2. A single node in the hidden layer, using a sigmoid activation function.
3. Two nodes in the hidden layer, using a ReLU (rectified linear unit) activation function.
4. Two nodes in the hidden layer, using a sigmoid activation function.
5. Three nodes in the hidden layer, using a linear activation function.

## Solution

To solve the XOR problem with a neural network, it is critical to understand that the XOR function is not linearly separable. This means you cannot draw a straight line to separate the output classes (0 and 1) in the 2D space of XOR inputs. Therefore, any solution involving a linear activation function (choices 1 and 5) will not work, as these configurations cannot model the non-linear decision boundary required by the XOR function.

A single node in the hidden layer (choice 2), regardless of the activation function used, will also not suffice. This is because a single node essentially attempts to find a linear boundary, and even though the sigmoid allows for non-linear transformations, a single sigmoid node on its own cannot capture the complexity of the XOR function.

Choice 3 suggests using ReLU activations. While ReLU introduces non-linearity and can in theory model complex functions given enough nodes and layers, in practical terms, a configuration of just two nodes using ReLU might struggle with the XOR problem due to how ReLU behaves (linear in the positive domain and zero elsewhere). It might not efficiently capture the XOR pattern without more nodes or a specific configuration.

The most feasible option provided here is choice 4: "**Two nodes in the hidden layer, using a sigmoid activation function.**" This setup can create a non-linear decision boundary needed for the XOR problem. A network of this configuration can learn to separate the XOR classes by essentially creating a curved decision surface, which is possible through the combination of multiple sigmoid-activated nodes in the hidden layer. Each node can learn to separate portions of the input space, and their combined outputs can then be used by the output layer to accurately predict XOR outputs.

## Correct Answer

4. Two nodes in the hidden layer, using a sigmoid activation function.

## Reasoning

The main reasoning behind choosing option 4 as the correct answer is the necessity for non-linear decision boundaries to solve the XOR problem. Linear activation functions can't model such boundaries. While ReLU provides non-linearity, its piece-wise linear nature might not be as effective in this specific minimal-setup scenario compared with sigmoid functions. Sigmoid functions allow for a smoother, more flexible decision boundary, which is critical for the XOR problem. With two sigmoid-activated nodes in the hidden layer, the network can effectively learn the complex, non-linear separation that the XOR function requires, enabling accurate modeling and prediction.
