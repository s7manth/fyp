## Question
Given a dataset consisting of sentences from English language textbooks, you are tasked with creating a neural language model that can predict the next word in a sequence given the previous words. The goal is to improve the fluency of generated text for an educational language-learning application. To achieve this, you decide to utilize a feedforward neural network model with a softmax output layer. Considering the computational efficiency and the need for capturing the context adequately, you have to decide the appropriate length of the input sequence (number of previous words to consider) and the embedding dimension for each word. Which combination of input sequence length and embedding dimension is likely to result in a model that appropriately balances computational efficiency with predictive performance?

1. Input sequence length of 5 words with an embedding dimension of 50
2. Input sequence length of 10 words with an embedding dimension of 100
3. Input sequence length of 20 words with an embedding dimension of 300
4. Input sequence length of 15 words with an embedding dimension of 200
5. Input sequence length of 25 words with an embedding dimension of 50

## Solution
To solve this problem, it's essential to understand the trade-offs involved in selecting the input sequence length and the embedding dimension. A longer input sequence allows the model to consider more context, potentially improving its ability to predict the next word. However, this also increases the computational complexity, as the number of parameters grows with the input size. On the other hand, the embedding dimension determines the size of the vector representing each word. A higher dimension can capture more nuanced semantic relationships between words but also increases the number of parameters and computational cost.

Considering these trade-offs:
- A shorter input sequence (e.g., 5 words) with a modest embedding dimension (e.g., 50) could be more computationally efficient but might lack the necessary context for high-quality predictions.
- At the other extreme, a very long input sequence (e.g., 25 words) with a low embedding dimension (e.g., 50) might not capture the semantic nuances effectively due to the low dimensionality, despite having a lot of context.
- A balanced approach is to choose an input length and embedding dimension that provide enough context and semantic detail without making the model prohibitively expensive to train. 

Given these considerations, **an input sequence length of 15 words with an embedding dimension of 200** strikes a balance. It offers sufficient context for most sentences, particularly in the context of language learning materials where sentences might not be exceedingly complex, and the embedding dimension is substantial enough to capture nuanced word relationships without being too large.

## Correct Answer
4. Input sequence length of 15 words with an embedding dimension of 200

## Reasoning
The choice of an input sequence length of 15 words and an embedding dimension of 200 balances between context size and semantic detail, which is crucial for language modeling. This setup is expected to provide enough contextual information for the model to make accurate predictions while also representing each word in the sequence with enough detail to capture semantic nuances. It avoids the pitfalls of choosing too short an input length, which might not provide enough context, and too high an embedding dimension, which could make the model unnecessarily complex and computationally intensive. Moreover, given the application (an educational language-learning tool), it's likely that focusing on a moderately sized context (neither too broad nor too narrow) will be most effective for generating fluent and contextually appropriate language outputs.
