## Question
Given a dataset containing tweets, your task is to classify tweets into positive and negative sentiments. You decide to use a feed-forward neural network for this classification task, and you recall the importance of pre-processing data for effective model training. After tokenization, your vocabulary size is notably large, causing concerns about the model's computational efficiency and generalization capability. You choose to apply techniques to reduce the vocabulary size without significant loss of relevant information. Which of the following techniques would NOT be effective in reducing the vocabulary size for the task at hand?

1. Removing stopwords.
2. Applying lemmatization.
3. Using word embeddings like Word2Vec or GloVe.
4. Increasing the minimum frequency threshold for words to be included in the vocabulary.
5. Randomly eliminating words from the vocabulary until it reaches a desired size.

## Solution
To answer this question, we need to understand how various pre-processing steps and techniques can affect the vocabulary size and, indirectly, the efficiency and performance of a neural network model for NLP tasks.

1. **Removing stopwords**: Stopwords are commonly used words (such as "the", "is", "in") that are usually considered noise in text data. Removing them can reduce the vocabulary size significantly without losing much substantive content, beneficial for model training.

2. **Applying lemmatization**: Lemmatization reduces words to their base or root form. For example, "running", "ran", and "runs" might all be reduced to "run". This process decreases the vocabulary size by merging different forms of a word into one, aiding in generalization and reducing model complexity.

3. **Using word embeddings like Word2Vec or GloVe**: Word embeddings map words into dense, continuous vector spaces, where semantically similar words are mapped to nearby points. While embeddings are incredibly useful for capturing semantic relationships between words and reducing dimensionality, they do not directly reduce the initial vocabulary size. Instead, they provide a way to efficiently represent words and their relationships for the model.

4. **Increasing the minimum frequency threshold for words to be included in the vocabulary**: Words that occur very infrequently in the dataset might not contribute much to the overall understanding or prediction task and can lead to overfitting. By setting a minimum frequency threshold, less frequent words are excluded from the vocabulary, thereby reducing its size.

5. **Randomly eliminating words from the vocabulary until it reaches a desired size**: This approach would likely remove important information along with the less informative parts of the vocabulary. Random elimination does not discern between words crucial for understanding the sentiment of a tweet and those that are not, making it a poor strategy for reducing vocabulary size effectively.

## Correct Answer
5. Randomly eliminating words from the vocabulary until it reaches a desired size.

## Reasoning
The correct answer is option 5. The rationale behind this choice is that randomly eliminating words fails to consider the importance or relevance of words to the classification task. Unlike the other methods listed, which are systematic and aim to preserve as much relevant information as possible while reducing the size of the vocabulary, random elimination could lead to the loss of critical data. Techniques like stopwords removal, lemmatization, and setting minimum frequency thresholds are targeted towards reducing redundancy and noise in the vocabulary without sacrificing essential content. Meanwhile, using word embeddings is a method for representing the reduced vocabulary efficiently, rather than reducing the vocabulary size itself. Therefore, random elimination is the least effective method among those listed for the specified goal of reducing vocabulary size without significant loss of relevant information in a sentiment classification task.
