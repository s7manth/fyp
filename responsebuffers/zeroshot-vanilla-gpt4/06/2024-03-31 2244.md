## Question

Given the challenges associated with training feedforward neural language models, particularly in handling the infamous "vanishing gradients" problem during backpropagation, recent NLP research has proposed various solutions. Which of the following techniques is NOT an effective solution for mitigating the vanishing gradients issue in the context of training deep feedforward neural language models?

1. Introducing skip connections between non-adjacent layers.
2. Utilizing activation functions like ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) instead of sigmoid functions.
3. Implementing LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) units within the feedforward architecture.
4. Employing batch normalization at each layer of the network.
5. Decreasing the learning rate progressively as training progresses.

## Solution

The vanishing gradients problem occurs when the gradient of the loss function decreases exponentially as it propagates back through the network, leading to very slow or even stagnant learning in the initial layers of the neural network. This is a critical issue, especially in deep networks, since it can significantly hamper the performance of the model.

1. **Skip connections** between non-adjacent layers help by allowing gradients to flow back more directly to earlier layers, thus mitigating the vanishing gradients problem. This technique is effectively used in architectures like ResNet.

2. **ReLU activation functions** help in this regard because they do not saturate in the positive domain unlike sigmoid functions, whose gradients can vanish as the functionâ€™s output approaches 0 or 1. Therefore, ReLU and its variants are commonly adopted to alleviate vanishing gradients in deeper networks.

3. **Implementing LSTM units within the feedforward architecture** is not a standard solution for vanishing gradients in feedforward networks. LSTM units are a fundamental component of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and are specifically designed to address issues related to learning long-term dependencies, not vanishing gradients in feedforward networks.

4. **Batch normalization** normalizes the input of each layer so that they have a mean output activation of zero and standard deviation of one. This prevents the activations from becoming too high or too low, thus tackling the issue of vanishing gradients to a certain extent.

5. **Decreasing the learning rate progressively** as training progresses (also known as learning rate annealing or scheduling) is a technique used to fine-tune the training of neural networks for better convergence. However, it does not directly address the vanishing gradients problem. This technique is more about improving the convergence of the training process by helping the model to settle in a more precise minimum.

## Correct Answer

3. Implementing LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) units within the feedforward architecture.

## Reasoning

The inclusion of LSTM units within the context of feedforward neural architectures to mitigate the vanishing gradient problem is conceptually misplaced. LSTMs are crucial to recurrent neural network designs where the goal is to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data, like time series or natural language. The vanishing gradient issue they primarily address is linked to these long sequences, rather than the depth of the network, which is the main concern in feedforward architectures. While LSTMs incorporate mechanisms (like gates and cell states) that are particularly designed to carry gradients across many timesteps effectively, inserting them within a feedforward structure does not align with their intended purpose and does not directly address the challenge of vanishing gradients in deep feedforward networks. On the other hand, the other solutions provided (skip connections, ReLU activations, and batch normalization) are directly relevant to the specific problems encountered when training deep feedforward neural networks, making option 3 the correct answer.
