## Question
Given the understanding of neural networks and their application in natural language processing, specifically in neural language modeling, consider a scenario where you are tasked with improving the performance of a feedforward neural network designed for text classification. The network is already achieving reasonable accuracy, but you have identified that it might be suffering from overfitting. Which of the following strategies could potentially improve the modelâ€™s generalization without significantly increasing the computational cost?

1. Increase the size of the hidden layers to capture more complex patterns in the dataset.
2. Apply dropout regularization by randomly omitting units from the network during training.
3. Use a deeper network architecture with more hidden layers to enhance the model's learning capability.
4. Replace the feedforward architecture with a recurrent neural network to better capture sequential dependencies.
5. Incorporate pretrained word embeddings like Word2Vec instead of training embeddings from scratch.

## Solution
To address overfitting in a neural network model, especially in the context of NLP and text classification, the goal is to enhance generalization to unseen data without considerably increasing computational demands. Let's evaluate each option based on this criterion:

1. **Increase the size of the hidden layers**: This option might actually exacerbate overfitting because larger models with more parameters are prone to fitting the training data too closely, thereby harming generalization.

2. **Apply dropout regularization**: Dropout is a well-known regularization technique that helps prevent overfitting in neural networks by randomly omitting units (along with their connections) from the network during training. This encourages the network to learn more robust features that are not reliant on any small set of units, thus improving generalization.

3. **Use a deeper network architecture with more hidden layers**: Similar to option 1, adding more layers can increase the model's capacity, potentially leading to overfitting. While deeper networks can theoretically model more complex patterns, without proper regularization, they may not necessarily generalize better to new data.

4. **Replace the feedforward architecture with a recurrent neural network (RNN)**: While RNNs are excellent for capturing sequential dependencies and might be beneficial for certain NLP tasks, this approach does not directly address overfitting. Additionally, RNNs can significantly increase the computational cost due to their sequential processing nature.

5. **Incorporate pretrained word embeddings like Word2Vec**: Using pretrained embeddings can improve model performance, especially when the dataset is small, by leveraging general linguistic patterns learned from large corpora. However, this technique primarily enhances the model's input representations rather than directly mitigating overfitting.

## Correct Answer
2. Apply dropout regularization by randomly omitting units from the network during training.

## Reasoning
Among the provided options, applying dropout regularization directly addresses the issue of overfitting by making the model less sensitive to the specific weights of neurons, thereby promoting a more generalized model that performs better on unseen data. This method achieves the goal of improving generalization without significantly increasing computational demands, making it the most suitable choice in the context of the question. Other options either do not tackle overfitting effectively, may exacerbate the problem, or could significantly increase the computational cost, hence are not as appropriate for the stated goal.
