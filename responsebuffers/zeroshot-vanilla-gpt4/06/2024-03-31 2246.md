## Question

Given a feedforward neural network designed for a natural language processing task that involves sentiment analysis on movie reviews (classifying them as positive or negative), the network architecture is composed of an embedding layer, two hidden layers with ReLU activation, and a softmax output layer for binary classification. After training, the model shows high accuracy on the training data but performs poorly on the validation set. This scenario demonstrates a classic problem in training neural networks. Which of the following strategies is likely to improve the model's generalization to unseen data?

1. Increase the number of hidden layers to capture more complex patterns in the training data.
2. Apply dropout regularization to the hidden layers to prevent overfitting by randomly omitting units from the network during training.
3. Replace the ReLU activation function with a linear activation function to reduce the model's non-linearity and complexity.
4. Increase the size of the embedding layer to enhance the model's ability to learn more nuanced representations of the input data.
5. Decrease the learning rate drastically to ensure that the model converges to the global minimum of the loss function more accurately.

## Solution

To solve this problem, it's pivotal to understand why the described phenomenon (high training accuracy but low validation accuracy) is occurring. This scenario is a classic case of overfitting, where the model learns the training data patterns, including noise, too well and fails to generalize to unseen data.

1. **Increasing the number of hidden layers** would typically make the network more complex, potentially exacerbating overfitting by enabling the network to capture even more intricate patterns that might be specific to the training data only.

2. **Applying dropout regularization** involves randomly setting a fraction of the input units to 0 at each update during training, which helps prevent overfitting by making the network less sensitive to the specific weights of neurons. This introduces noise into the output of hidden layers, making the model's learned representations more robust and improving generalization to unseen data.

3. **Replacing the ReLU activation function with a linear activation function** would make the individual layers essentially linear operations. Given that multiple linear layers stacked together still produce a linear operation, this change would dramatically reduce the model's capacity to capture complex, non-linear patterns in the data, which is not necessarily the solution to prevent overfitting. Instead, it could underfit by not capturing sufficient complexity.

4. **Increasing the size of the embedding layer** might improve the model's ability to learn nuanced representations but doesn't directly address the overfitting problem. In fact, it could potentially increase the chances of overfitting by adding more parameters to the model, making it more complex.

5. **Decreasing the learning rate drastically** might slow down training and does not directly prevent overfitting. A very small learning rate might make the training process unnecessarily long, and there's no guarantee it would address the overfitting issue. It could also lead to the model getting stuck in a local minimum.

Given these options, applying dropout regularization to the hidden layers (Option 2) is the most direct and effective strategy for improving the model's ability to generalize to unseen data by addressing overfitting.

## Correct Answer

2. Apply dropout regularization to the hidden layers to prevent overfitting by randomly omitting units from the network during training.

## Reasoning

Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, capturing noise and patterns specific to the training set, which do not generalize well to new, unseen data. The key to mitigating overfitting is to introduce regularization techniques that make the model less complex or sensitive to the specific details of the training data. Dropout regularization achieves this by randomly disabling a subset of neurons in the network during training, forcing the network to learn more robust features that are not reliant on any small set of neurons. This approach effectively enhances the model's ability to generalize, thus improving performance on unseen data such as a validation set.
