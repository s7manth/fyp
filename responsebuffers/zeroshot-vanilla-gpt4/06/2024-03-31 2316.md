## Question
Given the context of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, the XOR problem is often cited as an illustrative example of why non-linear models like neural networks are necessary for solving complex problems. Consider the task of sentiment analysis where you are required to categorize text inputs into 'positive' or 'negative' sentiment. Your dataset consists of short text snippets from movie reviews. You decide to build a feed-forward neural network to automate this process. Which of the following modifications to your neural network architecture or training process could potentially improve the model's ability to capture the non-linear relationships inherent in the sentiment analysis task, as inspired by the solution to the XOR problem?

1. Increasing the depth of the network by adding more layers, thus enabling the capturing of more complex, non-linear relationships between input features and output classification.
2. Implementing a linear activation function such as the identity function in all hidden layers to ensure the linearity of the model and increase training speed.
3. Reducing the size of the input feature vector to minimize computational complexity, thus speeding up the training process without significantly impacting model accuracy.
4. Using a bag-of-words model for text representation and a single-layer perceptron for classification, ensuring simplicity and interpretability of the model.
5. Incorporating dropout at training time in some layers to prevent overfitting by randomly omitting subsets of features or neurons and ensuring that the model generalizes well to unseen data.

## Solution
To solve the XOR problem, and by extension, to effectively model complex, non-linear relationships in NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis, one must leverage the power of neural networks' non-linearity and ability to learn hierarchical representations. Let’s analyze each option in the context of improving a neural network's capability:

1. **Increasing the depth of the network by adding more layers**: This approach is fundamentally sound for capturing complex, non-linear relationships. Deep neural networks can learn hierarchical feature representations, which is crucial for tasks where the relationship between input features and the target output is not linear or simple, such as in sentiment analysis. Each additional layer can theoretically capture a higher level of abstraction, making this option viable and effective.

2. **Implementing a linear activation function in all hidden layers**: This modification would not improve the network’s ability to capture non-linear relationships. The primary reason neural networks can address problems like XOR or complex sentiment analysis tasks is their use of non-linear activation functions. Using a linear activation function would render the deep network no more capable of capturing complex patterns than a single-layer perceptron, since the composition of linear functions is itself linear.

3. **Reducing the size of the input feature vector**: This approach might improve computational efficiency but does not inherently address the model's ability to capture non-linear relationships. While reducing input dimensionality can help with computational and memory efficiency, and sometimes with reducing overfitting by eliminating noisy features, it does not contribute to solving complex non-linear problems directly.

4. **Using a bag-of-words model with a single-layer perceptron**: This method simplifies the model but at the cost of significantly reducing its capacity to model non-linear relationships. A single-layer perceptron cannot solve non-linear problems like XOR, and similarly, it would struggle with complex sentiment analysis tasks where the sentiment cannot be determined by the presence of individual words alone (e.g., considering negations or idiomatic expressions).

5. **Incorporating dropout at training time**: Dropout is a regularization technique designed to prevent overfitting by randomly omitting subsets of features or neurons during the training. This can encourage the learning of more robust and generalized features by preventing the network from becoming too reliant on any small set of neurons and, hence, can indirectly contribute to the model's ability to capture and generalize non-linear relationships in data. It doesn’t directly increase the network's non-linear problem-solving capability but supports the learning process by enhancing generalization.

Given the aim to improve the ability to capture non-linear relationships, the most directly relevant modifications are those that enhance the neural network's capacity for complex representation learning and non-linear transformation. Thus, the best options are **increasing the depth of the network** and **incorporating dropout to prevent overfitting**, which aids in generalizing the learned non-linear relationships.

## Correct Answer
1. Increasing the depth of the network by adding more layers, thus enabling the capturing of more complex, non-linear relationships between input features and output classification.

## Reasoning
The XOR problem's relevance to neural network design highlights the importance of non-linearity and complexity in model architecture to solve problems that cannot be linearly separated. Increasing the depth of a neural network (adding more layers) directly contributes to the model's ability to learn more complex, non-linear relationships. This is because additional layers allow the network to form hierarchical representations of the data, which is particularly crucial for nuanced tasks like sentiment analysis, where the relationship between text inputs and sentiments is not straightforward. This method directly impacts the neural network's capability to address non-linear problems by allowing for the capture and processing of increasingly abstract relationships in the data, making it the most effective modification for enhancing the model's performance on tasks requiring the understanding of complex, non-linear patterns.
