## Question
Consider you are building a feedforward neural network (FNN) to perform sentiment analysis on movie reviews. Your goal is to classify the reviews into positive, neutral, and negative sentiments. The dataset consists of reviews preprocessed into embedding vectors, with each review represented as a 300-dimensional vector. You decide to use a two-layer FNN with ReLU activation for the hidden layer.

Given your network architecture, which of the following approaches would be the most effective in addressing the vanishing gradient problem during training, while also considering the potential for overfitting on your dataset?

1. Increasing the learning rate and applying dropout to the hidden layer.
2. Employing batch normalization before the activation function in the hidden layer.
3. Utilizing a deeper network architecture with additional hidden layers.
4. Replacing ReLU activation with sigmoid activation in the hidden layer.
5. Applying L1 regularization on the weights of the hidden layer.

## Solution
### Step 1: Understand the question
The question asks for the best approach to address the vanishing gradient problem and mitigate overfitting while training a 2-layer feedforward neural network for sentiment analysis.

### Step 2: Analyze the options
1. **Increasing the learning rate and applying dropout**: Dropout is a technique for preventing overfitting by randomly dropping units from the neural network during training. However, merely increasing the learning rate might exacerbate the vanishing/exploding gradient problem rather than solve it.

2. **Employing batch normalization before the activation function**: Batch normalization can alleviate the vanishing gradient problem by normalizing the input layer by adjusting and scaling the activations. It also has a regularizing effect, which can address overfitting to some extent.

3. **Utilizing a deeper network architecture**: Adding more layers might increase the model's capacity and performance on the training dataset, but without specific mechanisms to address the vanishing gradient problem (like introduction of certain types of normalization or activation functions), simply adding more layers could aggravate the issue. Moreover, a deeper network might overfit even more if not properly regularized.

4. **Replacing ReLU activation with sigmoid activation**: The ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation function is actually known for helping mitigate the vanishing gradient problem compared to sigmoid. Sigmoid functions can exacerbate vanishing gradients because their derivatives can be very small.

5. **Applying L1 regularization on the weights**: L1 regularization encourages sparsity in the model weights, potentially leading to simpler models that generalize better. While it's a technique for addressing overfitting, it doesn't directly address the vanishing gradient problem.

### Step 3: Choose the best option
Based on the analysis, **Employing batch normalization before the activation function in the hidden layer** emerges as the best approach. It directly addresses the vanishing gradient issue and has a beneficial effect on controlling overfitting, thereby matching our requirements.

## Correct Answer
2. Employing batch normalization before the activation function in the hidden layer.

## Reasoning
Batch normalization helps in stabilizing the learning process and drastically reduces the number of training epochs required to train deep networks. By normalizing the input layer by adjusting and scaling the activations, it mitigates the problem of internal covariate shift. This normalization helps in alleviating the vanishing gradients problem by maintaining the gradients in a reasonable range. Additionally, the regularizing effect of batch normalization partly addresses overfitting by adding some noise to the layers' activations, akin to a mild form of dropout. Therefore, given the problem statement and the options provided, employing batch normalization before the activation function in the hidden layer is the most effective approach for addressing the vanishing gradient problem while also considering the potential for overfitting in the dataset.
