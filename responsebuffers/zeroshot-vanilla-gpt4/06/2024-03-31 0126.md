## Question
You are assigned to improve a neural language model for a text classification task focused on sentiment analysis. The initial model is a simple feed-forward neural network. Despite its satisfactory performance on training data, it significantly underperforms on the validation set. After investigating, you hypothesize that the model's inability to capture the context and order of words is a major issue. To address this, you plan to redesign the neural architecture by incorporating mechanisms that can better understand the sequential nature of text. Which of the following architectural changes would most directly address the underlying issue of modeling word context and order?

1. Increasing the depth of the network by adding more hidden layers to the existing feed-forward architecture.
2. Replacing the activation function from ReLU to sigmoid in all layers.
3. Integrating a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layer before the output layer.
4. Implementing dropout on the input layer to reduce overfitting on the training data.
5. Scaling input features to have zero mean and unit variance across the whole dataset.

## Solution
The problem highlighted in the question is the model's ineffective capability in capturing the context and order of words in text, which is crucial for tasks such as sentiment analysis. Each option is analyzed based on how it addresses this specific issue:

1. **Increasing the depth of the network** could potentially help the model learn more complex patterns. However, simply adding more hidden layers to a feed-forward structure does not directly enable the handling of sequential data or the comprehension of the context and order of words.

2. **Changing the activation function** from ReLU to sigmoid affects how the network models non-linearities. This change does not inherently improve the model's ability to process sequential data or understand context.

3. **Integrating an LSTM layer** directly tackles the core issue. LSTM networks are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) designed to recognize patterns in sequences of data, such as text for NLP tasks. They can remember information for long or short periods, making them particularly suited for modeling word order and context within sentences or longer texts.

4. **Implementing dropout** is a technique used to prevent overfitting by randomly setting a fraction of input units to 0 at each update during training time. While it may help in improving the generalization of the model, it does not directly improve the model's ability to understand sequential data or word context.

5. **Scaling input features** is a preprocessing step to normalize data, ensuring that the neural network has a stable and faster convergence. However, this does not contribute to modeling the sequence or context of the text.

Therefore, introducing an LSTM layer into the architecture is the most direct and effective solution to the problem stated.

## Correct Answer
3. Integrating a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layer before the output layer.

## Reasoning
The LSTM's ability to capture long-term dependencies makes it especially suited for tasks requiring an understanding of word order and context, like sentiment analysis. Unlike options 1, 2, 4, and 5, which don't specifically address the challenge of sequential data processing, integrating an LSTM layer directly tackles the issue of capturing the sequential nature of language. This makes it the optimal choice for improving the performance of a neural language model on tasks that benefit from an understanding of word context and order.
