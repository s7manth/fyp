## Question
In the context of natural language processing (NLP), a crucial task is sentiment analysis of user-generated reviews. Considering the use of a feed forward neural network (FFNN) for classifying these reviews into positive or negative sentiments, you aim to improve the accuracy of your model. The initial model uses a basic architecture with embeddings for input words and a softmax output layer. Given that the dataset contains a significant amount of idiomatic expressions and sarcasm, which often invert the sentiment of a sentence ("This movie is not bad" implying the movie is good), which of the following modifications to your FFNN architecture is most likely to enhance its performance in accurately classifying such nuanced expressions?

1. Increase the depth of the network by adding more hidden layers, relying on the increased model complexity to capture the nuanced sentiment expressions more effectively.
2. Integrate a convolutional neural network (CNN) layer before the first hidden layer to capture local dependencies between words more effectively.
3. Replace the softmax output layer with a sigmoid activation function to allow for multi-label classification, thus handling sentences with mixed sentiments more effectively.
4. Incorporate an attention mechanism to allow the model to focus on specific words or phrases that are more indicative of the overall sentiment, despite the presence of idiomatic expressions and sarcasm.
5. Implement word n-grams as input features instead of word embeddings, expecting the model to better capture the context around negations and idiomatic expressions.

## Solution
To address the challenge of accurately classifying sentiments in the presence of idiomatic expressions and sarcasm, it's essential to examine how each proposed modification would potentially impact the model's ability to understand nuanced language expressions.

1. **Increasing the depth of the network**: Adding more hidden layers can increase the model's capacity to learn complex patterns. However, it may not specifically address the challenge of understanding the context and subtleties of language, such as sarcasm or idiomatic expressions, without appropriate feature representation.

2. **Integrating a CNN layer**: CNNs are effective in capturing local dependencies and can be useful for identifying salient features in text data (e.g., phrases indicative of sentiment), but they might still struggle with understanding the overall context, especially with non-literal language use.

3. **Replacing the softmax with a sigmoid activation function**: Sigmoid functions are used for binary classification or multi-label classification problems. However, since sentimental analysis in this context is primarily a binary classification problem (positive vs. negative), the choice of activation function in the output layer (softmax for multiclass, sigmoid for binary) is not the core issue in handling sarcasm or idiomatic expressions.

4. **Incorporating an attention mechanism**: An attention mechanism can enable the model to focus on specific parts of the input text that are more informative for the sentiment classification task, potentially allowing it to weigh idiomatic expressions or sarcastic comments more appropriately in the context of the entire sentence or text.

5. **Implementing word n-grams as input features**: Using n-grams could help the model capture some context around specific words or phrases, including negations and idiomatic expressions. However, this approach might still not be as effective as mechanisms that allow the model to dynamically focus on the most relevant parts of the text for understanding sentiment, especially with longer texts where the contextual cues are distantly located from the key phrases.

Given these considerations, the option that directly addresses the challenge of deciphering nuanced expressions and sarcasm by enabling the model to dynamically focus on critical parts of the input is incorporating an attention mechanism.

## Correct Answer
4. Incorporate an attention mechanism to allow the model to focus on specific words or phrases that are more indicative of the overall sentiment, despite the presence of idiomatic expressions and sarcasm.

## Reasoning
Attention mechanisms provide a way for models to allocate varying degrees of importance to different parts of the input data. In the context of sentiment analysis, where identifying the sentiment often depends on specific keywords or phrases, especially in sentences with sarcasm or idiomatic expressions, the capacity to adjust focus dynamically across the input text can be particularly beneficial. It allows the model to "pay more attention" to parts of the input that significantly influence the sentiment. This approach addresses the challenge of nuanced language use by enabling a more sophisticated understanding of context, beyond what simple embeddings or additional layers might achieve. Hence, incorporating an attention mechanism is the most direct and effective strategy among the given options for enhancing the model's performance in classifying sentiments accurately under these conditions.
