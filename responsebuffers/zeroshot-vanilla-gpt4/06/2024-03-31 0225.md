## Question

Given a feed-forward neural network tasked with the challenge of classifying whether a given sentence belongs to English literature or scientific texts, which of the following factors would NOT contribute significantly to improving the model's accuracy?

1. Increasing the number of hidden layers in the network.
2. Utilizing a larger pre-trained word embedding like Word2Vec or GloVe for vector representation.
3. Implementing dropout regularization on the input layer only.
4. Enlarging the training dataset with more labeled examples of both categories.
5. Applying a softmax function to the output of the last hidden layer.

## Solution

### Correct Answer

5. Applying a softmax function to the output of the last hidden layer.

### Reasoning

1. **Increasing the number of hidden layers in the network** - This approach can improve the model's accuracy by enabling it to learn more complex patterns and relationships in the data. Deep networks can capture hierarchical features that might be crucial for distinguishing between different styles of text such as English literature and scientific texts.

2. **Utilizing a larger pre-trained word embedding like Word2Vec or GloVe for vector representation** - Pre-trained embeddings are beneficial because they already encapsulate contextual relationships between words based on massive corpora. By starting with these embeddings, the model can benefit from this pre-existing knowledge, potentially improving its capability to understand and differentiate the nuances in language that characterize English literature versus scientific texts.

3. **Implementing dropout regularization on the input layer only** - While implementing dropout on the input layer can help prevent overfitting by randomly dropping input features, thereby forcing the network to generalize better, applying dropout regularization effectively should ideally be targeted across multiple layers in the network, not just the input layer. This option, though technically a valid technique to combat overfitting, is less impactful compared to others listed here in the context of improving model accuracy comprehensively.

4. **Enlarging the training dataset with more labeled examples of both categories** - A larger and more varied training dataset can significantly improve the model's performance. By covering a wide range of writing styles and topics within English literature and scientific texts, the model can learn to capture and generalize the distinctions between the categories more effectively.

5. **Applying a softmax function to the output of the last hidden layer** - The softmax function is applied to convert the raw output scores from the network into probabilities, which are easier to interpret for classification tasks. However, this does not directly contribute to improving the accuracy of the model in the same way as increasing data diversity, model complexity, or implementing advanced regularization techniques. Its role is crucial for interpreting the neural network's output, but it doesn't enhance the model's learning ability or its capacity to differentiate between classes inherently.

Therefore, while applying a softmax function is essential for the model to output interpretable probabilities, its inclusion does not significantly contribute to improving the model's accuracy in discerning between English literature and scientific texts, as it's a standard procedure rather than an accuracy-enhancing measure.
