## Question
In the context of natural language processing, global coherence in textual data can be understood as the property that makes a text interpretable as a whole, rather than just as a collection of individual sentences. Given a complex, multi-document summarization task where the input is a set of related news articles about a recent event and the output is a concise summary, which of the following techniques would most effectively ensure that the generated summary maintains global coherence?

1. Employing an attention mechanism that merely focuses on sentence-level extractive features from individual documents.
2. Utilizing a document clustering algorithm prior to summarization to group related content, followed by a summarization model that includes document-level context in its representation.
3. Applying a simple frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) mechanism to identify and concatenate the most important sentences from each document.
4. Implementing a sequence-to-sequence model that treats each document as an independent input without any mechanism for capturing inter-document relationships.
5. Constructing a graph-based representation of the entire document set where nodes represent sentences or paragraphs and edges denote semantic similarity or discourse relations, followed by a graph neural network to generate the summary.

## Solution
To ensure global coherence in a summary generated from multiple documents, the chosen technique must be capable of understanding and synthesizing information across all documents, recognizing the relationships between different pieces of text, and maintaining the overall narrative structure.

1. **Employing an attention mechanism** that merely focuses on sentence-level extractive features from individual documents might help to identify important sentences but would likely fail to capture the global coherence as it ignores the inter-document context and relationships crucial for multi-document summarization.
   
2. **Utilizing a document clustering algorithm** prior to summarization to group related content, followed by a summarization model that includes document-level context in its representation, would help in organizing and understanding the structure of the dataset but may still fall short in capturing the intricate narrative and thematic relationships necessary for global coherence.
   
3. **Applying a simple TF-IDF mechanism** to identify and concatenate the most important sentences from each document focuses on keyword significance rather than the narrative structure or logical flow between sentences and documents, which is insufficient for maintaining global coherence.
   
4. **Implementing a sequence-to-sequence model** that treats each document as an independent input without any mechanism for capturing inter-document relationships would be inadequate for multi-document summarization tasks where understanding cross-document content and structure is essential for global coherence.
   
5. **Constructing a graph-based representation** of the entire document set where nodes represent sentences or paragraphs and edges denote semantic similarity or discourse relations, followed by a graph neural network to generate the summary, is the most comprehensive approach. This technique can effectively capture and utilize the complex network of relationships between different parts of the text, both within and across documents, allowing for the generation of summaries that are not only concise but also globally coherent.

## Correct Answer
5. Constructing a graph-based representation of the entire document set where nodes represent sentences or paragraphs and edges denote semantic similarity or discourse relations, followed by a graph neural network to generate the summary.

## Reasoning
The question evaluates the understanding of concepts related to global coherence and how it can be maintained in the complex task of multi-document summarization. Technique 5 is the correct answer because it directly addresses the requirement to understand and synthesize information across documents, which is essential for maintaining global coherence. Unlike the other options, this approach integrates comprehensive inter-textual relationships, including semantic similarity and discourse relations, into the model's representation. A graph-based representation coupled with a graph neural network effectively captures the intricate web of relationships across the document set, thereby ensuring that the produced summary reflects the collective narrative and information structure of the input texts, which is the essence of global coherence in textual data.
