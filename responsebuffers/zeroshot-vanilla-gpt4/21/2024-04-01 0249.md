## Question

Given a large corpus of text documents, a Natural Language Processing (NLP) research team aims to implement a system that can automatically analyze and improve the coherence of written texts. The team decides to leverage both local and global coherence models to ensure comprehensive enhancement. Considering the latest advancements in NLP and techniques discussed throughout your course, which combination of approaches would most effectively fulfill the team's objective of analyzing and improving the coherence of texts?

1. Utilize a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for identifying local coherence patterns and a graph-based approach for modeling global coherence by capturing document-wide entity relations.
2. Implement a Transformer-based model, specifically trained on coherence assessment tasks for both local and global coherence, without distinguishing between the two concepts during training.
3. Deploy a rule-based system that relies on discourse markers for local coherence and a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model to ensure topic consistency across the document for global coherence.
4. Apply a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for extracting sentence-level features to assess local coherence and use a PageRank algorithm on sentences based on similarity for establishing global coherence.
5. Integrate a GPT-3 model fine-tuned on a coherence-graded corpus to generate coherent text variants and then employ a BERT-based summarization model to evaluate and adjust global coherence through summarization relevance.

## Solution

### Step-by-step approach:

- **Local Coherence**: Involves sentence-to-sentence relations and the smooth flow of concepts and entities in nearby text segments. Effective local coherence models analyze and improve how well sentences fit together, maintaining clear and logical progression from one idea to the next.
    - RNNs have historically been used for sequence modeling tasks but might not capture long-distance dependencies as effectively as newer architectures.
    - Transformers and their variants (e.g., GPT-3, BERT) excel in capturing both short and long-range dependencies in text, thus offering a robust solution for identifying complex coherence patterns.
    - CNNs, while useful in NLP for pattern recognition at the word or character level, might not inherently grasp the sequential logic required for local coherence.
    - Rule-based systems can capture certain local coherence aspects but may lack the flexibility to adapt to the wide variety of coherence patterns present in natural language.

- **Global Coherence**: Concerns the overall structure and flow of the document, ensuring the text is unified around core themes or narratives.
    - Graph-based models effectively capture relationships and interactions at the document level, allowing for nuanced understanding of global coherence through entity relations and thematic consistency.
    - LDA for topic consistency and summarization models can provide insights into thematic coherence but might not fully address structural and narrative flow aspects.
    - Transformers, when properly trained, can also understand and generate text with an awareness of global coherence, given their ability to consider wide context spans.

### Decision-making:

- **Option 1**: Combines a nuanced approach for local coherence using RNNs (though not the most advanced option) with a strong model for global coherence through graph-based entity relations. This option acknowledges the distinct nature of local and global coherence without blurring the lines between them.
- **Option 2**: Represents a cutting-edge approach, leveraging a single, unified transformer-based model. This could be effective but risks diluting the specific strategies optimal for each coherence type.
- **Option 3**: Offers a simpler, more interpretable strategy but may not capture the complexity of natural language sufficiently compared to neural approaches.
- **Option 4**: CNNs and PageRank offer interesting perspectives but may not naturally align with the inherent sequential and hierarchical nature of textual coherence.
- **Option 5**: Utilizes state-of-the-art models (GPT-3 for text generation and BERT for summarization) which are very powerful but might generalize coherence improvement at the expense of specific local vs. global strategies.

### Conclusion:
The most effective combination, given the current state of NLP research and the task specifics, seems to be **Option 1**. It tailors distinct, theoretically grounded approaches to both local and global aspects of coherence, even though it could potentially benefit from more recent architectures like Transformers for local coherence.


## Correct Answer

1. Utilize a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for identifying local coherence patterns and a graph-based approach for modeling global coherence by capturing document-wide entity relations.

## Reasoning

Option 1 is chosen based on a detailed evaluation of the strengths and limitations of various models discussed. It reflects a balance between specialized tasks â€” leveraging RNNs for their sequential processing capabilities suitable for local coherence, and graph-based models for their adeptness at modeling complex networks of entities and themes for global coherence. This option distinctly addresses the requirements for enhancing both local and global coherence in documents, acknowledging the nuanced differences between these aspects and utilizing tailored approaches for each. While more advanced models like Transformers offer promising alternatives, especially for local coherence, the combination of RNNs and graph-based modeling provides a focused solution that explicitly caters to the varying demands of improving textual coherence, aligning closely with the latest research and practical NLP applications discussed during the course.
