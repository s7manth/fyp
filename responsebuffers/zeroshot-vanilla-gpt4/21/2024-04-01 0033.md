## Question
Consider a scenario where you are designing a natural language processing system aimed at evaluating the coherence of multi-paragraph essays. Your system needs to efficiently assess both local and global coherence to provide feedback for educational purposes. Given the complexity of coherence in language, you decide to integrate various NLP techniques and models. Which combination of approaches would most effectively meet the requirements for assessing coherence in multi-paragraph essays?

1. Utilize a bag-of-words model for local coherence and a simple recurrent neural network (RNN) for global coherence.
2. Apply a transformer-based model like BERT for local coherence and a graph-based approach for global coherence, mapping the discourse structure.
3. Employ an entity-grid model for local coherence and a conditional random field (CRF) model for representing the transitions between different parts of the essay.
4. Use a convolutional neural network (CNN) for extracting sentence-level features and a sequence-to-sequence model for assessing the overall document structure.
5. Implement a rule-based system for detecting coherence relations at the sentence level and a latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model for uncovering topics and their distribution for global coherence.

## Solution
### Correct Answer
2. Apply a transformer-based model like BERT for local coherence and a graph-based approach for global coherence, mapping the discourse structure.

### Reasoning
To evaluate the coherence of multi-paragraph essays effectively, a system must address both local and global coherence aspects. 

**Local Coherence** refers to the logical and semantic connection between adjacent sentences or within small text spans. Local coherence can be effectively analyzed using advanced representation learning models that capture nuanced contextual relationships between words and sentences. **Transformer-based models like BERT** excel in this domain because they are designed to understand the context of words in sentences by considering the full text in which they appear. BERT's attention mechanism allows it to capture complex word interactions, making it highly suitable for assessing sentence-to-sentence coherence.

**Global Coherence**, on the other hand, involves the overall logical flow and structure of the document, ensuring that all parts of the text are relevant to the main topic and logically ordered. A **graph-based approach** for global coherence is effective because it allows for the representation of the essay's structure as a graph, where nodes can represent paragraphs or sentences, and edges can depict relationships between them (e.g., narrative flow, argumentative structure). This structure can then be analyzed to assess how well-connected and organized the essay is, offering a high-level overview of its coherence.

- Option 1's use of a bag-of-words model and a simple RNN would be limited in effectiveness due to the inability of these approaches to capture the complex semantic relationships necessary for assessing coherence. 
- Option 3's entity-grid model, while useful for capturing some aspects of local coherence related to entity occurrence, does not offer the depth of contextual understanding provided by models like BERT. Additionally, CRFs, although powerful for sequence modeling, may not capture the full complexity and hierarchy of global discourse structure in essays.
- Option 4's CNN for sentence-level feature extraction and a sequence-to-sequence model might capture aspects of text structure but lack the sophisticated understanding of sentence-to-sentence semantic relationships necessary for local coherence assessment.
- Option 5's rule-based system and LDA model lack the advanced, context-sensitive analysis provided by approaches like BERT for local coherence and graph-based models for global coherence.

Therefore, the combination of a transformer-based model and a graph-based approach (option 2) offers a comprehensive and sophisticated method for evaluating both local and global coherence in essays, making it the best choice among the given options.
