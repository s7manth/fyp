## Question
Given a document $D$ consisting of sentences $S_1, S_2, ..., S_n$, you are tasked with designing an NLP system that evaluates its global coherence. Global coherence in this context refers to the extent to which the document as a whole is logically organized and cohesive. Assume you have access to state-of-the-art representation learning models, entity recognition tools, and a corpus of documents annotated for coherence relations and discourse structures. Which of the following approaches best combines these resources for evaluating global coherence in document $D$?

1. Train a deep neural network model on the annotated corpus to predict coherence relations between adjacent sentences, then score $D$ based on the average confidence of predicted coherence relations across all adjacent sentence pairs.
2. Utilize entity recognition to identify key entities in $D$ and track their mentions and transitions from sentence to sentence using Centering Theory, scoring the document based on the consistency and continuity of these entities.
3. Implement a two-stage process where the first stage uses a representation learning model to generate embeddings for each sentence in $D$, and the second stage applies a clustering algorithm on the embeddings to measure the document’s thematic consistency.
4. Integrate a discourse structure parser to identify the rhetorical structure of $D$, and then assess global coherence by the degree to which the document adheres to commonly observed rhetorical patterns in the annotated corpus.
5. Combine entity recognition with representation learning to first identify entities and their attributes in $D$, then employ a graph neural network that uses the learned representations for both the entities and the sentences to evaluate the structural and thematic coherence of the document.

## Solution
To effectively evaluate global coherence in a document, it's essential to appreciate the multifaceted nature of coherence: it encompasses not just the logical flow and connectedness of ideas (thematic consistency) but also the systematic development and tracking of entities and concepts throughout the text (structural coherence). The best approach, thus, leverages technologies and theories that address these aspects holistically.

- **Option 1** focuses on coherence relations between adjacent sentences, which contributes to understanding local coherence but might not sufficiently capture the global structural and thematic coherence of the entire document.
- **Option 2** leverages Centering Theory for tracking entities, which is a strong methodology for assessing coherence in terms of how entities are introduced and maintained across a narrative. However, it does not directly assess thematic consistency or the overall rhetorical structure of the document.
- **Option 3** looks at thematic consistency through clustering of sentence embeddings, which can reveal patterns in topic distribution. While innovative, this method primarily captures thematic elements but may overlook the structural coherence and the nuanced progression of ideas and entities.
- **Option 4** employs a discourse structure parser, a powerful tool for understanding how parts of the text relate to each other at a macro level (global coherence), including identification of rhetorical strategies. This approach stands out because it directly targets the logical organization and cohesive progression criteria inherent in assessing global coherence.
- **Option 5** attempts an integrated approach using entity recognition and representation learning. While this method is comprehensive, combining structural (entities and their relations) and thematic coherence (via representation learning), its complexity and the dependency on graph neural networks' ability to effectively interpret these combined data points may pose practical challenges in accurately capturing global coherence.

Considering the above, **Option 4** presents a methodology that most directly and effectively addresses the requirements for evaluating global coherence by focusing on the document’s rhetorical structure and logical organization.

## Correct Answer
4. Integrate a discourse structure parser to identify the rhetorical structure of $D$, and then assess global coherence by the degree to which the document adheres to commonly observed rhetorical patterns in the annotated corpus.

## Reasoning
The rationale for choosing Option 4 lies in its direct approach to evaluating global coherence by understanding the rhetorical structure of a document. Global coherence is not just about thematic consistency or entity tracking but encompasses the document's overall logical structure and how well it aligns with coherent discourse patterns. A discourse structure parser facilitates an understanding of this structure, enabling the assessment of whether the document as a whole is logically organized and cohesive. This approach aligns well with the definition of global coherence and leverages existing annotated corpora to inform the evaluation, offering a practical, theory-driven solution to the complex problem of assessing global coherence in a document.
