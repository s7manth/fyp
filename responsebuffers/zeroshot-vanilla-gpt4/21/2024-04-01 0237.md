## Question
Consider a scenario where you are analyzing a complex document with the aim of improving its global coherence through natural language processing techniques. This document contains multiple paragraphs, each with its own local coherence but lacking a clear, cohesive overall narrative structure. To enhance the global coherence of this document using NLP, you decide to employ a combination of computational models and linguistic theories.

Which of the following approaches is most likely to contribute to improving the global coherence of the document?

1. Applying a sequence-to-sequence model to rewrite individual sentences for more concise expression without altering the sequence of paragraphs.
2. Utilizing a discourse structure parsing technique to identify and reorder discourse segments, ensuring a logical progression of ideas from one paragraph to the next.
3. Implementing a named entity recognition (NER) system to consistently label entities throughout the document, without modifying the document's structure.
4. Employing a centering theory-based model to focus on improving intra-sentential coherence without considering the relationship between different sentences and paragraphs.
5. Developing a representation learning model that focuses solely on local coherence within paragraphs by evaluating sentence embeddings without considering inter-paragraph relations.

## Solution
To address global coherence in a document that already exhibits local coherence within each paragraph, the solution must consider the document's overall narrative structure. This involves strategies that analyze and potentially reorganize the document's structure to ensure a logical and cohesive flow of ideas, improving the reader's ability to follow the overarching narrative or argument being presented. 

1. **Applying a sequence-to-sequence model** focuses on the sentence level, aiming to improve the conciseness and clarity of individual sentences. However, this approach does not directly address the inter-sentence or inter-paragraph relationships critical to enhancing global coherence.

2. **Utilizing a discourse structure parsing technique** directly targets the structure of the discourse, identifying and potentially reordering segments (e.g., paragraphs) to ensure a logical and cohesive progression of ideas. This approach is well-aligned with the goal of improving global coherence by facilitating a clearer and more logical narrative flow through the entire document.

3. **Implementing a named entity recognition (NER) system** helps ensure consistent entity labeling throughout the document, which can aid in maintaining coherence at a local level (e.g., ensuring the same entity is referred to in the same way). While this consistency is important for both local and global coherence, it does not directly address structural issues that may be disrupting the global narrative flow.

4. **Employing a centering theory-based model** is primarily focused on intra-sentential coherence and resolving anaphora within and between sentences. While important for local coherence and ensuring sentences relate well to each other, this approach does not tackle the document-wide structural considerations necessary for improving global coherence.

5. **Developing a representation learning model for local coherence** emphasizes analyzing and improving the coherence within paragraphs by looking at sentence embeddings. While this is critical for ensuring sentences within a paragraph are cohesive, it does not address the relationships and transitions between paragraphs, which are critical for global coherence.

## Correct Answer
2. Utilizing a discourse structure parsing technique to identify and reorder discourse segments, ensuring a logical progression of ideas from one paragraph to the next.

## Reasoning
The key to improving global coherence lies in ensuring that the document presents a logical and cohesive flow of ideas that are easy for the reader to follow. This involves not just crafting coherent sentences and paragraphs (local coherence) but also organizing these paragraphs in such a way that the narrative or argument unfolds logically and effectively (global coherence).

A discourse structure parsing technique directly addresses this need by analyzing the overall structure of the text to identify how different segments (such as paragraphs) relate to each other. It can then be used to reorder these segments if necessary, ensuring that the document progresses in a manner that makes logical sense from the perspective of the narrative or argument being presented. This approach bridges the gap between the local coherence present within each paragraph and the needed global coherence of the document as a whole, directly tackling the challenge laid out in the question.
