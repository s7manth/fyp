## Question
Consider the task of automating the grading of student essays using NLP techniques. A crucial aspect of this automation involves assessing the global coherence of an essay, i.e., its logical flow and the organization of ideas across sentences and paragraphs. Assuming you have access to advanced NLP tools and models, which approach would best allow you to automatically evaluate the global coherence of student essays?

1. Train a language model (e.g., GPT-3) on a large dataset of texts, then fine-tune it on a smaller dataset of high-quality, professionally written essays and let it predict the next sentence given a context. Measure the deviation of the actual next sentences in student essays from the predicted ones.
2. Use a syntax-based approach by parsing each sentence to construct a syntactic tree, then analyze the depth and structure of these trees across the essay to infer coherence.
3. Implement a text segmentation algorithm to identify topic boundaries in the essay, then employ a topic modeling technique like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to evaluate how well topics flow logically from one to another.
4. Leverage a pre-trained transformer-based model like BERT, fine-tuned on a corpus of essays graded for coherence by human experts, to directly classify essays into categories based on their level of global coherence.
5. Apply centering theory to identify the most prominent entities in each paragraph and assess how well these entities maintain coherence by tracking their appearance and roles throughout the essay.

## Solution
The question asks for the best approach to automatically evaluate the global coherence of student essays, which indicates the necessity to understand the logical flow and organization of ideas across different parts of the texts. Each option addresses this challenge differently, focusing on various aspects of NLP and text analysis.

1. **Language Model Prediction**: While predicting the next sentence given a context can assess local coherence or the fluency of sentences, it might not effectively measure the global coherence that encompasses the overall logical flow and structure of the entire essay.
   
2. **Syntax-Based Approach**: Analyzing the depth and structure of syntactic trees may offer insights into sentence complexity and variation but falls short in assessing global coherence, as it primarily focuses on grammatical rather than thematic or logical relationships between different essay parts.
   
3. **Text Segmentation and Topic Modeling**: This approach directly tackles the notion of global coherence by identifying topic boundaries and evaluating the logical flow of topics throughout the essay. It captures the thematic structure, which is a crucial aspect of global coherence.
   
4. **Transformer-Based Classification**: Using a pre-trained model like BERT, fine-tuned on essays graded for coherence, directly aims to classify the overall coherence of the essay. It leverages deep learning to understand complex patterns related to coherence in texts, but the success heavily depends on the quality and size of the training dataset.
   
5. **Centering Theory**: Focusing on the consistency and tracking of prominent entities throughout an essay can indicate subject maintenance and thematic progression, which are elements of global coherence. However, this approach might not fully capture the logical flow and organization of broader ideas and arguments across the entire essay.

Considering these analyses, the best approach to evaluating the global coherence of student essays seems to be:

**3. Implement a text segmentation algorithm to identify topic boundaries in the essay, then employ a topic modeling technique like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to evaluate how well topics flow logically from one to another.**

## Correct Answer
3. Implement a text segmentation algorithm to identify topic boundaries in the essay, then employ a topic modeling technique like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to evaluate how well topics flow logically from one to another.

## Reasoning
This approach is the most directly aligned with assessing global coherence. It respects the complexity of essay writing by focusing on the thematic structure and logical progression of topics. Unlike local coherence or syntactic complexity, global coherence necessitates understanding how different parts of a text connect and flow into each other on a thematic level. Text segmentation allows for discerning these structural boundaries, and LDA provides a method for analyzing the logical and thematic consistency across segments. This synthesis of segmentation and modeling thus offers a nuanced and comprehensive way to evaluate essays for global coherence, making it the most suitable option among the given choices.
