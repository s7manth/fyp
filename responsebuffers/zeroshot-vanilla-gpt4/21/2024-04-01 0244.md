## Question

Given a large corpus of scientific articles in the field of Biology, you are tasked with developing a model to automatically summarize these articles. Your goal is to ensure that the generated summaries are not only factually accurate but also exhibit a high degree of coherence, both locally between contiguous sentences and globally across the entire summary. Assuming you have access to state-of-the-art NLP tools and models, which approach would best achieve local and global coherence in the generated summaries?

1. Train a GPT-3 model on the corpus and use its text generation capabilities to produce summaries directly, relying on its internal mechanism to ensure coherence.
2. Utilize a BERT-based model for sentence embedding, followed by k-means clustering to identify central ideas in the article, and then generate summaries based on the clusters, using a rule-based system to ensure logical flow between sentences.
3. Implement a hybrid model that first uses a discourse structure parser to identify coherence relations between sentences in the original articles, then employs an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) network trained on these relations to generate coherent summaries.
4. Adopt a two-stage approach where the first stage uses a Transformer-based model to generate initial summaries and the second stage employs an entity-based coherence model, focusing on the centering theory, to refine the summaries for better local and global coherence.
5. Design a model that relies entirely on a large pre-trained language model, like GPT-3, fine-tuned with a customized loss function that penalizes incoherence based on a computational model of global coherence derived from graph-theoretical approaches to document structure.

## Solution

To determine the best approach for achieving high local and global coherence in generated summaries, it's important to understand the nature of coherence and the capabilities of various models mentioned in the choices.

- **Choice 1** hinges on using GPT-3's innate capabilities. While GPT-3 is known for generating human-like text, simply relying on its internal mechanism without explicit handling of coherence relations or structure might not guarantee the desired level of coherence across all generated summaries.

- **Choice 2** employs a BERT-based model for identifying central ideas and a rule-based system for ensuring logical flow. This might improve local coherence to some extent; however, it doesn't explicitly address the global coherence across the entire summary.

- **Choice 3** proposes using a discourse structure parser to identify coherence relations, combined with an LSTM network, to take explicit advantage of these relations in summary generation. This approach directly targets the improvement of coherence by understanding the structure of an article.

- **Choice 4** suggests a two-stage process with initial summary generation followed by refinement for coherence. The mention of centering theory and an entity-based model indicates a focused effort to improve both local and global coherence by tracking entities and their prominence across the summary.

- **Choice 5** is about leveraging a computational model of global coherence based on graph theory, fine-tuned on a pre-trained model like GPT-3. While this approach mentions explicit handling of coherence, it seems more focused on global coherence and might not address local coherence as effectively as other choices.

Considering the question's emphasis on both local and global coherence in summaries, **Choice 4** proposes the most comprehensive approach. It not only relies on advanced text generation techniques using Transformer models but also incorporates an explicit refinement step focused on coherence, making use of centering and entity-based theories known for their effectiveness in tracking and improving coherence in texts.

## Correct Answer

4. Adopt a two-stage approach where the first stage uses a Transformer-based model to generate initial summaries and the second stage employs an entity-based coherence model, focusing on the centering theory, to refine the summaries for better local and global coherence.

## Reasoning

Local coherence relates to the logical and fluent connection between contiguous sentences, often maintained via lexical chains, explicit connectives, and syntactic similarity. Global coherence, on the other hand, concerns the overall thematic structure and the unity of various parts of a text to convey a cohesive narrative or argument.

The refinement step in **Choice 4**, focusing on centering theory and an entity-based coherence model, addresses both these aspects effectively. Centering theory helps in maintaining local coherence by ensuring smooth transitions and connections between sentences, focusing on the continuity and salience of entities. An entity-based coherence model can aid in maintaining global coherence by ensuring that the entities and themes central to the article are consistently and appropriately emphasized throughout the summary.

This choice stands out because it not only produces initial summaries using a capable Transformer-based model but also explicitly refines these summaries with a focus on coherence, which is key to meeting the question's requirements for both local and global coherence in generated summaries.
