## Question

Given a set of sentences extracted from a research paper abstract, you are developing a model to predict the coherence of the text based on entity-based coherence and global coherence concepts. Assume that the model uses a combination of techniques including discourse structure parsing and representation learning models for measuring local and global coherence. It takes advantage of both explicit discourse markers and implicit relations inferred through contextual embeddings. Which of the following techniques, if implemented effectively, would MOST likely improve the accuracy of your model's predictions?

1. Exclusively increasing the size of the pre-trained language model used for generating contextual embeddings, without fine-tuning for the specific task.
2. Incorporating an attention mechanism that allows the model to weigh the significance of different sentences and entities differently based on their position and frequency in the text.
3. Relying solely on the syntactic structure of sentences to infer coherence, disregarding the semantic relationships between entities across sentences.
4. Training the model on a dataset composed only of text from research paper abstracts within a narrow field, assuming a homogeneous structure of discourse across different domains.
5. Implementing a rule-based method that strictly follows a predefined order of discourse structure, not adapting to the variability in writing styles among different authors.

## Solution

To effectively improve the accuracy of the model's predictions in predicting text coherence, especially in a context that involves both entity-based coherence and global coherence, let's analyze each option based on the principles of discourse analysis, coherence relations, and the capabilities of representation learning models and attention mechanisms:

1. **Increasing the size of the pre-trained language model:** This might enhance the model's ability to understand complex language nuances because of the richer representations larger models can provide. However, without fine-tuning for the specific task of predicting coherence, improvements might not be directly aligned with the requirements of detecting coherence patterns.

2. **Incorporating an attention mechanism:** This approach enables the model to dynamically focus on different aspects of the text, such as which sentences or entities are more important for maintaining coherence. Attention mechanisms are especially useful in understanding the context and how different text segments relate to each other, aligning well with the needs for measuring both local and global coherence.

3. **Relying solely on syntactic structure:** Coherence is not only a matter of syntax but also heavily relies on semantic relationships. Thus, focusing solely on syntax overlooks crucial aspects of how entities and ideas connect across sentences, making this approach less effective.

4. **Training the model on narrowly focused dataset:** While domain-specific training can help in understanding the nuances of a particular field, coherence measures should be robust across different text types. Limiting the training to a narrow field might not provide the model with enough variety of discourse structures and styles, potentially reducing its general applicability.

5. **Implementing a rule-based method with fixed order:** This method does not account for the variability and complexity of natural text, especially research abstracts that can significantly vary in structure. Rigid rule-based methods are less flexible in capturing the nuances of text coherence.

Given these considerations, the technique that would most likely improve the model's accuracy in predicting text coherence is:

2. Incorporating an attention mechanism that allows the model to weigh the significance of different sentences and entities differently based on their position and frequency in the text.

## Correct Answer

2. Incorporating an attention mechanism that allows the model to weigh the significance of different sentences and entities differently based on their position and frequency in the text.

## Reasoning

The reasoning behind choosing option 2 as the correct answer lies in understanding the essential components of coherence prediction models. Entity-based coherence focuses on how entities are introduced and referred to across a text, requiring the model to track entities and their relationships. Global coherence concerns the overall logical flow of information, requiring understanding the text as a whole. An attention mechanism provides a flexible framework for both tasks. It allows the model to dynamically adjust which parts of the text (i.e., sentences, entities) are more critical for maintaining coherence at any point in the discourse. This adaptability is crucial for handling the variability in text structures and for capturing both local and global coherence aspects, thereby enhancing the model's accuracy in predicting text coherence.
