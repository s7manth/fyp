## Question

Given an advanced research project aiming to enhance the ability of a machine learning model to assess the global coherence of long scientific texts, you decide to experiment with combining several NLP techniques. Your objective is to ensure the model can grasp the underlying structure and logic that tie the text's sections and subsections together into a cohesive narrative. Which of the following approaches would be the most effective strategy for this purpose?

1. Solely focusing on syntactic parsing of sentences to identify grammatical relationships and using these as the basis for assessing text coherence.

2. Implementing an entity-based coherence model that tracks the introduction, re-introduction, and continuity of entities throughout the text, combined with discourse structure parsing to model the text's hierarchical structure.

3. Exclusively utilizing word embeddings to capture semantic similarity between adjacent sentences without considering the document's overall discourse structure.

4. Designing a deep learning model that relies entirely on surface-level text features, such as n-grams, without delving into the deeper discourse and semantic relationships between text components.

5. Applying a purely rule-based approach to identify and categorize discourse markers and connectors without analyzing their context or the entities involved in the discourse.

## Solution

The question revolves around combining natural language processing techniques to improve a model's understanding of global coherence in long scientific texts. Global coherence refers to the extent to which the entire text is logically structured and comprehensible as a unified whole, rather than just being a collection of coherent sentences or paragraphs. This involves both the document's architectural structure (e.g., how sections and subsections are related) and the flow of content (e.g., how ideas or entities are introduced and developed).

Option 2, "Implementing an entity-based coherence model that tracks the introduction, re-introduction, and continuity of entities throughout the text, combined with discourse structure parsing to model the text's hierarchical structure," is the most effective strategy among the given choices. This approach addresses both the need to understand the roles and relationships of entities within the text (centering and entity-based coherence) and the architectural narrative structure (discourse structure parsing).

**Entity-based coherence models** help in tracking entities throughout the text, examining how they are introduced, maintained, and evolved in the discourse. This is crucial for understanding the thematic elements of the text and how well they are interwoven to maintain topic continuity.

**Discourse structure parsing**, on the other hand, delves into understanding the hierarchical organization of the text. It identifies various discourse relations between sentences and larger text segments, which is essential for grasping how individual pieces of the text contribute to the overall narrative.

Option 1 focuses only on syntax, which, while important for understanding sentence-level grammar, does not directly address global coherence, which requires insight into document-level structure and flow.

Option 3 utilizes word embeddings to capture semantic similarity but lacks the structural analysis necessary for assessing global coherence. Word embeddings are more suited for capturing local coherence or semantic relatedness between shorter text spans.

Option 4 emphasizes surface-level features such as n-grams, which can be useful for certain tasks but insufficient for understanding the deeper discourse-level coherence of a text. This approach fails to capture the semantic and thematic structure that underpins global coherence.

Option 5 employs a rule-based methodology for identifying discourse markers, which can be useful as part of a larger system but on its own is too limited for assessing global coherence, especially without considering the broader context or the entities involved in the discourse.

## Correct Answer

2. Implementing an entity-based coherence model that tracks the introduction, re-introduction, and continuity of entities throughout the text, combined with discourse structure parsing to model the text's hierarchical structure.

## Reasoning

The reasoning for selecting option 2 as the correct answer is based on its comprehensive approach to analyzing text coherence. This strategy integrates the understanding of both the entity dynamics within the text and the document's overarching structural narrative. By combining entity-based coherence models with discourse structure parsing, one can effectively assess how well the text maintains its thematic and logical integrity across long stretches of discourse. This dual focus on entity tracking and structural analysis directly addresses the challenge of evaluating global coherence in scientific texts, making it the most effective strategy among the given options.
