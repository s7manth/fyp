## Question
A research team is developing a novel natural language processing (NLP) system aiming to improve the summarization of scientific articles. Their innovative approach intends to leverage not just the topical relevance of sentences but also the global coherence of the generated summaries. As part of their model, they plan to integrate a technique that models both centering and global coherence to achieve more human-like summaries. Which of the following techniques would be *most* appropriate for incorporating into their system to enhance its ability to understand and maintain global coherence in the context of article summarization?

1. Training a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)-based model on sentence-level embeddings, focusing solely on semantic similarity without considering the position or order of sentences.
2. Developing a custom discourse parser that analyzes the rhetorical structure of the entire document to understand the hierarchical and sequential relationships between different sections and paragraphs.
3. Implementing an entity recognition module to track the frequency and recency of named entities appearing throughout the article, using this information to prioritize sentences containing core entities in the summary.
4. Utilizing a sequence-to-sequence model with attention mechanisms that focus on the most relevant sentences, without explicitly modeling the passages' coherence or discourse structure.
5. Incorporating a representation learning model that captures local coherence via sentence embeddings while also integrating a graph-based approach to model the global discourse structure of the article, allowing the system to understand and maintain the narrative flow in the summary.

## Solution

To solve this problem, it's essential to understand the concepts of centering, local coherence, and global coherence within the context of document summarization. Centering theory deals with the coherence created by the attention given to certain entities within a discourse, emphasizing how subjects and objects maintain narrative focus. Local coherence refers to the semantic and syntactical relationships between neighboring sentences or propositions. Meanwhile, global coherence is about the overall structure and logical flow of the discourse across the entire document.

1. **BERT-Based Model**: While BERT-based models are powerful for capturing semantic relationships between sentences due to their deep contextual embeddings, they don't inherently understand or model the global coherence of a document, especially if they're focused on sentence-level embeddings without considering sentence order or narrative flow.

2. **Custom Discourse Parser**: A custom discourse parser that understands the rhetorical structure provides a solid foundation for modeling global coherence. It recognizes the hierarchical relationships between different document parts, which is crucial for summarization that respects the original narrative structure. However, without integration with entity tracking (centering), it might not fully capture the nuances of narrative focus and shift.

3. **Entity Recognition Module**: Tracking named entities can indeed contribute to understanding narrative focus shifts (a part of centering theory) but on its own does not guarantee global coherence. This approach might help prioritize important sentences but won't necessarily ensure the summary is logically coherent on a global scale.

4. **Sequence-to-Sequence with Attention**: While sequence-to-sequence models, especially with attention mechanisms, are adept at identifying and focusing on relevant parts of the input, they primarily excel in maintaining local coherence. They may struggle with global coherence if not explicitly designed to consider the overall narrative structure or discourse.

5. **Representation Learning with Graph-Based Approach**: This option offers a comprehensive solution by addressing both local and global coherence. By capturing local coherence through sentence embeddings, it respects semantic and syntactical relationships. The integration of a graph-based approach to model the global discourse structure ensures the system understands the overall narrative flow, important for generating coherent summaries that feel natural to humans.

The best option that satisfies the requirements for improving global coherence in addition to considering centering is:

**5. Incorporating a representation learning model that captures local coherence via sentence embeddings while also integrating a graph-based approach to model the global discourse structure of the article, allowing the system to understand and maintain the narrative flow in the summary.**

## Correct Answer

5. Incorporating a representation learning model that captures local coherence via sentence embeddings while also integrating a graph-based approach to model the global discourse structure of the article, allowing the system to understand and maintain the narrative flow in the summary.

## Reasoning

This option strategically combines the strengths of understanding local coherence through advanced sentence embeddings and global coherence via modeling the discourse structure as a graph. This dual approach is uniquely suitable for summarization tasks, as it ensures that the generated summaries are both locally coherent (in terms of adjacent sentence relation) and globally coherent (maintaining the narrative flow and logical structure of the entire document). Unlike the other options, it explicitly acknowledges and addresses the need for understanding and maintaining global coherence, which is critical for producing human-like summaries of complex articles.
