## Question

In the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), various techniques have been proposed to assess and enhance the coherence of text. Consider a scenario where you need to automatically evaluate the coherence of narratives using a combination of discourse structure parsing and machine learning models. Your task involves understanding the relationships between sentences and ensuring that the narrative maintains both local and global coherence throughout the text. Given the following methodologies, which approach would best allow a system to assess the coherence of a narrative, considering the complex interplay between surface realization, discourse relations, and entity coherence?

1. Train a Transformer-based model directly on a large corpus of narratives, employing a binary classification task where the model predicts if a narrative is coherent or not, without any explicit modeling of discourse structures or entity coherence.
2. Use a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to model sentence transitions within narratives, relying solely on sequential sentence embeddings to predict narrative coherence.
3. Deploy a hybrid model that combines Centering Theory for local coherence, focusing on saliency, transitions, and continuity of entities, with an LSTM-based model parsing the Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) discourse tree for global coherence.
4. Implement a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect patterns in sentence embeddings that signal breaks in coherence, without distinguishing between local or global coherence.
5. Create a generative model that rewrites portions of narratives to enhance coherence by introducing or modifying rhetorical relations and entity references, then uses a simple heuristic to rank the narrative based on the number of changes made.

## Solution

The best approach to assess the coherence of narratives, which considers local and global coherence, along with the relationships between sentences and the overall narrative structure, is:

3. Deploy a hybrid model that combines Centering Theory for local coherence, focusing on saliency, transitions, and continuity of entities, with an LSTM-based model parsing the Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) discourse tree for global coherence.

## Correct Answer

3. Deploy a hybrid model that combines Centering Theory for local coherence, focusing on saliency, transitions, and continuity of entities, with an LSTM-based model parsing the Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) discourse tree for global coherence.

## Reasoning

To assess the coherence of a narrative effectively, an NLP system must consider both local and global coherence. Local coherence refers to the relationship between adjacent sentences or propositions, ensuring smooth transitions and maintaining the relevance and salience of entities throughout the discourse. Global coherence, on the other hand, refers to the overall logical and thematic structure of the narrative, ensuring that all parts of the text contribute to the development of the main idea or story.

Option 1 and Option 2, focusing on Transformer-based and RNN models respectively, do not explicitly model discourse structures or entity coherence, which are critical for assessing narrative coherence effectively. These models might capture some aspects of coherence through large-scale learning from coherent vs. incoherent texts, but they miss the explicit modeling of discourse relations and entity transitions that are crucial for a nuanced understanding of coherence.

Option 4, using a CNN to detect patterns in sentence embeddings, similarly falls short because it does not distinguish between local and global coherence and lacks an explicit mechanism for understanding discourse relations and entity progression throughout the narrative.

Option 5 suggests a generative model to rewrite narratives for enhanced coherence. While an interesting approach for improving coherence, this method does not provide an assessment mechanism based on the understanding of discourse structures or entity continuity; it rather attempts to create coherence through modification, and its evaluation heuristic is overly simplistic and not indicative of true narrative coherence.

Option 3 proposes a hybrid model that explicitly models both the local and global dimensions of coherence by combining Centering Theory (for modeling local coherence through entity saliency and transitions) with an LSTM-based approach to parsing Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) discourse trees (for global coherence). This method addresses the requirements for understanding coherence comprehensively, considering both the progression of entities and the overarching logical structure of the narrative. The integration of Centering Theory and RST discourse analysis provides a robust framework for assessing the coherence of narratives in a nuanced and informed manner, making it the best choice among the given options.
