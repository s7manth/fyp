## Question

Consider a scenario in which you are designing an algorithm for enhancing the global coherence of a multi-document summarization system. The system's overarching goal is to generate comprehensive summaries from several documents discussing related topics. Given the complexity of ensuring that the summaries are not only factually accurate but also globally coherent, you decide to focus on representation learning models for local coherence as a foundational component for improving global coherence. Which of the following strategies best describes a method to leverage representation learning models for improving the local coherence within summaries, thereby indirectly enhancing the global coherence of the multi-document summarization?

1. Training a deep learning model exclusively on sentence-level embeddings to predict the next sentence in a sequence, ignoring the document-level context and inter-document relations.
2. Utilizing a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)-based model to generate embeddings for each sentence, followed by a clustering algorithm to group sentences with similar meanings, irrespective of their source document.
3. Implementing a graph-based representation learning model that incorporates sentence embeddings as nodes and co-reference links between entities across documents as edges, to capture both intra-document and inter-document entity relations.
4. Employing a sequence-to-sequence model, where the input is a sequence of sentences from the source documents and the output is a grammatically correct, coherent summary, without specifically focusing on entity relations or sentence embeddings.
5. Applying a vanilla Transformer architecture to encode each document separately and aggregating the document embeddings to produce a summary, explicitly ignoring sentence-level coherence and entity-centric information for simplicity.

## Solution

To improve the local coherence within summaries, which indirectly enhances the global coherence, it is crucial to consider not only the sentence-level information but also the document-level context and, importantly, the inter-document relations. This comprehensive approach ensures the summaries are not only coherent within themselves but also consistent and logically structured when information from multiple documents is integrated.

1. **Incorrect:** This choice focuses only on predicting the next sentence based on sentence-level embeddings. While this can enhance local coherence by ensuring sentences follow each other logically, it doesn't utilize document-level context or address inter-document relationships, which are critical for global coherence in multi-document summarization.

2. **Incorrect:** While using BERT-based models for generating sentence embeddings and clustering them based on similarity can help identify related information, this approach does not directly address coherence. It focuses on grouping similar meanings but doesn't account for the narrative or logical flow necessary for coherence, especially at the global level across multiple documents.

3. **Correct:** Implementing a graph-based representation learning model that treats sentence embeddings as nodes and co-reference links between entities across documents as edges can effectively capture both intra-document and inter-document entity relations. This method directly contributes to enhancing local coherence by ensuring that entities and their references are consistently used and linked within and across summaries. By maintaining entity consistency and logical connections, this strategy significantly contributes to global coherence in multi-document summarization.

4. **Incorrect:** A sequence-to-sequence model focuses on converting a sequence of sentences into a coherent summary. While it can ensure grammatical coherence and local logical flow, it doesn't explicitly address the challenge of incorporating entity relations or maintaining consistency across multiple documents, which are essential for global coherence.

5. **Incorrect:** Using a vanilla Transformer architecture to encode documents separately without focusing on sentence-level coherence or entity-centric information oversimplifies the problem. This approach may produce summaries that are contextually relevant but lacks in terms of coherence, especially when integrating information from multiple sources.

## Correct Answer

3. Implementing a graph-based representation learning model that incorporates sentence embeddings as nodes and co-reference links between entities across documents as edges, to capture both intra-document and inter-document entity relations.

## Reasoning

The key to improving global coherence in multi-document summarization lies in effectively managing and integrating information both within and across documents. A graph-based representation learning model uniquely addresses this challenge by considering sentence embeddings and entity relations simultaneously. By modeling sentences as nodes and using co-reference links as edges, the model can maintain entity consistency and ensure logical information flow across different documents. This not only enhances local coherence by keeping entity references clear and consistent but also significantly improves global coherence by maintaining a logical and cohesive narrative when summarizing related topics from multiple documents.
