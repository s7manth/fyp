## Question

Consider an experimental setup where you are tasked with developing a machine learning model to assess the global coherence of academic essays. Your goal is to distinguish between well-structured, coherent essays and those that are poorly structured and lack coherence. You plan to leverage representation learning models as part of your solution. Which of the following approaches would be most effective in capturing the global coherence of the essays?

1. Utilizing a unidirectional LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) network to model the sequence of sentences in each essay, focusing on capturing the forward flow of ideas.
2. Deploying a bidirectional LSTM network to capture the forward and backward dependencies between sentences, thereby understanding the contextual relationship throughout the essay.
3. Implementing a transformer-based model fine-tuned on a large corpus of academic writing, using attention mechanisms to capture the relationships between all parts of the essay.
4. Using a simple feed-forward neural network with pre-trained sentence embeddings for each sentence in the essay, focusing on individual sentence quality rather than their relationships.
5. Applying a graph-based neural network that models the essay as a graph where sentences are nodes and coherence relations between sentences are edges.

## Solution

To assess global coherence effectively, the model must understand not just the local sentence-to-sentence progression but also how the different parts of an essay relate to and support each other globally. The most effective model would capture dependencies and relationships among all parts of the essay, not just adjacent ones.

1. **Unidirectional LSTM:** This approach captures the sequence of ideas but primarily in a forward direction. It may miss backward context that is vital for understanding global coherence, as it assumes a linear progression without considering feedback loops or non-linear dependencies.

2. **Bidirectional LSTM:** This model improves upon the unidirectional LSTM by considering both forward and backward sequences. It is better at capturing context and relationships between sentences, but it may still struggle with long-distance dependencies, which are common in assessing global coherence.

3. **Transformer-based model:** Transformers leverage self-attention mechanisms that inherently consider all parts of the input data simultaneously. This allows transformers to capture complex dependencies and relationships across the entire essay, not limited by distance. Given that it's fine-tuned on academic writing, it would possess domain-specific knowledge beneficial for global coherence assessment. 

4. **Simple feed-forward network with sentence embeddings:** While this model can capture the quality of individual sentences through embeddings, it lacks the capacity to understand the relationships and flow between sentences. Essentially, it misses the aspect of coherence by focusing solely on the quality of discrete components.

5. **Graph-based neural network:** Modeling essays as graphs where sentences are nodes and coherence relations serve as edges is a novel approach. It allows for non-linear relations and could capture complex inter-sentential coherence patterns. However, its effectiveness heavily depends on accurately determining and representing coherence relations as edges, which can be challenging.

Given these considerations, the approach that most effectively captures global coherence is **Option 3: Implementing a transformer-based model fine-tuned on a large corpus of academic writing, using attention mechanisms to capture the relationships between all parts of the essay.** 

## Correct Answer

3. Implementing a transformer-based model fine-tuned on a large corpus of academic writing, using attention mechanisms to capture the relationships between all parts of the essay.

## Reasoning

Transformers are inherently well-suited for tasks that require understanding complex dependencies because of their self-attention mechanism, which allows each part of the input to attend to every other part directly. This characteristic is particularly beneficial for assessing global coherence in texts, where the relationship between non-adjacent sentences or ideas plays a critical role. Furthermore, fine-tuning a transformer model on domain-specific data (in this case, a corpus of academic writing) ensures that the model can leverage learned patterns and styles pertinent to academic essays. Consequently, this approach is best positioned to assess and discriminate between varying levels of global coherence in essays.
