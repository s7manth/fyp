## Question
Imagine you are developing a cutting-edge natural language processing (NLP) system designed to understand and generate long passages of text. Your goal is to ensure that the generated texts not only make sense on a sentence-to-sentence basis but also maintain a high level of global coherence. You decide to explore various NLP models and techniques that could help achieve this. Which of the following approaches is most likely to yield improvements in the global coherence of generated texts?

1. Fine-tuning a pre-trained Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model exclusively on a large corpus of well-structured texts.
2. Employing a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cells to capture sentence-to-sentence transitions, without any direct mechanism for modeling relationships between distant sentences.
3. Utilizing a Graph Neural Network (GNN) that constructs a discourse graph of the text, where nodes represent sentences and edges represent various types of coherence relations between sentences.
4. Implementing an n-gram model with a high n-value to capture longer dependencies between words across sentences, assuming adequate computational resources.
5. Applying a rule-based system that follows a fixed set of coherence patterns derived from linguistic studies, without adaptation to the specific domain of the generated texts.

## Solution

The question aims to evaluate students' understanding of different techniques and models in NLP that are relevant to enhancing the global coherence of generated texts.

1. Fine-tuning a BERT model can significantly improve the understanding and generation of coherent texts, as BERT's attention mechanism allows it to capture dependencies between words and sentences. However, its primary architecture is more suited for capturing local rather than global coherence due to its fixed-length input constraint, making it challenging to directly model relationships between distant parts of a long text.

2. While LSTMs are good at capturing short to medium-range dependencies and transitions in text, they are not specifically designed to model global coherence. LSTMs might struggle with long texts due to their sequential nature, which makes them less effective for understanding the global structure and coherence relations between distant sentences.

3. Utilizing a GNN that models the text as a discourse graph effectively addresses the challenge of global coherence. This approach allows for the explicit modeling of relationships between sentences, regardless of their distance within the text, by capturing various types of coherence relations (such as cause-effect, contrast, and similarity) between sentences. This method is directly focused on understanding and improving the global coherence of texts.

4. An n-gram model with a high n-value might capture longer dependencies than typical n-gram models, but its effectiveness severely diminishes as n increases due to the exponential growth in the number of parameters and the sparsity of data. Furthermore, n-gram models are inherently limited in their capacity to model global coherence since they focus on local word sequence probabilities rather than the thematic or logical relationships between sentences.

5. A rule-based system may incorporate some understanding of coherence patterns, but its lack of flexibility and adaptability makes it inferior to models that can learn complex patterns from data. Rule-based systems are also less likely to capture the nuances of global coherence in varied and complex texts since they rely on a predefined set of rules rather than learning from the corpus.

Therefore, the most effective approach for improving global coherence in text generation, given the provided options, is the utilization of a Graph Neural Network to construct a discourse graph.

## Correct Answer

3. Utilizing a Graph Neural Network (GNN) that constructs a discourse graph of the text, where nodes represent sentences and edges represent various types of coherence relations between sentences.

## Reasoning

The reasoning behind choosing the GNN-based discourse graph approach lies in its inherent design to model complex relations between different parts of the text, which is essential for achieving global coherence. This technique allows for an explicit and structured representation of the text's discourse, making it possible to grasp the holistic structure of the document. By capturing various types of coherence relations, a GNN can help ensure that the generated text maintains a logical, thematically consistent flow that aligns with human patterns of storytelling and information organization, significantly enhancing global coherence beyond what other listed models and techniques can achieve.
