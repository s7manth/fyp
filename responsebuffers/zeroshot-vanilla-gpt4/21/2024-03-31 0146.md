## Question

In the context of building a sophisticated model for document-level sentiment analysis which involves understanding the nuanced sentiment evolution across a text, a researcher aims to incorporate discourse structure parsing for better capturing the overall sentiment conveyed by complex, multi-sentence user reviews. The task is challenging due to the nuanced way sentiment can progress, with sentences supporting, contrasting, or even reversing the sentiment expressed in previous sentences. Given this scenario, which approach below best leverages discourse structure parsing to enhance the sentiment analysis model's ability to capture global sentiment coherence throughout a document?

1. Train a neural network model to identify named entities and their associated sentiments in each sentence, and then apply a majority vote across sentences to determine the document-level sentiment.
2. Utilize a pretrained transformer-based model to embed sentences and employ a clustering algorithm to identify shifts in sentiment, interpreting clusters as indicative of overall document sentiment.
3. Parse the document into a discourse tree using Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST), and weigh sentiments expressed in nucleus spans more heavily than those in satellite spans when aggregating to document-level sentiment.
4. Apply a sequence-to-sequence model to predict the sentiment of each sentence in isolation, subsequently using a hidden Markov model (HMM) to predict the sequence of sentiments across sentences in the document.
5. Implement a rule-based system to identify specific discourse markers (e.g., "however", "but", "moreover") that signal shifts or continuations in sentiment, and use these signals to guide document-level sentiment aggregation.

## Solution

To arrive at the correct answer, it is crucial to understand the nature of discourse structure parsing and how it can be applied to sentiment analysis, especially in the context of capturing global sentiment coherence within complex documents. Let's evaluate each option:

1. **Identifying named entities with associated sentiments** does not directly leverage discourse structure, focusing instead on entity-based sentiment without considering the document's overall structure or how sentiments progress and interact.

2. **Using a pretrained transformer and clustering for sentiment shifts** introduces an advanced embedding technique but does not explicitly use discourse structure parsing to understand the relations and hierarchy between sentences, which is critical for deciphering the overall sentiment trajectory.

3. **Parsing with Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST)** and giving different weights to sentiments based on their role in the discourse structure (nucleus vs. satellite) directly uses discourse structure to better understand the document's sentiment. RST can reveal how the discourse is organized and how different parts contribute to the overall sentiment, with nucleus spans typically carrying the main discourse contribution.

4. **Predicting sentence sentiment with a sequence-to-sequence model** followed by using an HMM for sequence sentiment analysis introduces a sequential analysis of sentiments but misses the nuanced understanding of discourse structure, such as how sentences support or oppose each other beyond a linear sequence.

5. **A rule-based system identifying discourse markers** can signal sentiment shifts or continuations but simplifies sentiment analysis to the presence of markers without deeply analyzing the structure and interrelations of discourse components.

Given the above evaluations, the option that best leverages discourse structure parsing for enhancing sentiment analysis, particularly by considering how sentiments are contextualized and weighted within the documentâ€™s structure, is:

**3. Parse the document into a discourse tree using Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST), and weigh sentiments expressed in nucleus spans more heavily than those in satellite spans when aggregating to document-level sentiment.**

## Correct Answer

3. Parse the document into a discourse tree using Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST), and weigh sentiments expressed in nucleus spans more heavily than those in satellite spans when aggregating to document-level sentiment.

## Reasoning

Parsing documents into discourse trees with RST enables the model to understand not just the presence of sentiments but their structural significance and contribution to the overall sentiment of the document. RST distinguishes between nucleus and satellite spans, where the nucleus typically contains the central idea of a discourse unit, and satellites provide supporting information. In the context of sentiment analysis, this approach allows the model to weigh sentiments contained within the nucleus more heavily because they are more likely to represent the core sentiment the author wishes to convey. This method captures the global coherence of sentiment progression in a nuanced and structurally informed manner, reflecting a deeper analysis of how sentiment is constructed and evolved throughout the text.
