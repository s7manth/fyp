## Question

In an effort to improve the summarization capabilities of a deep learning model, a researcher plans to integrate both local and global coherence mechanisms. The approach involves enhancing the representation learning process to prioritize entity-based coherence for local understanding while also encoding discourse structures to capture global coherence. This improved model is expected to generate summaries that are not only contextually relevant but also maintain logical flow and coherence throughout the text. Given the following actions, select the most effective sequence to achieve this integration:

1. Pre-train the model using a large corpus to learn word embeddings that capture semantic similarities.
2. Implement an entity-based coherence model using Centering Theory to focus on the transitions between utterances.
3. Encode global coherence by parsing the discourse structure of the text using Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) and represent this structure in the model.
4. Fine-tune the model on a summarization-specific dataset to adapt the learned embeddings and coherence mechanisms to summary generation tasks.
5. Evaluate the model on unseen data to assess improvements in the coherence of generated summaries.

A. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5  
B. 2, 1, 3, 4, 5  
C. 1, 3, 2, 4, 5  
D. 3, 2, 1, 4, 5  
E. 2, 3, 1, 4, 5

## Solution

The correct sequence should strategically introduce both local (entity-based) and global (discourse structure) coherence mechanisms after foundational word embeddings have been learned. This ensures the model first understands basic semantic relationships before delving into more complex coherence patterns.

1. **Pre-train the model using a large corpus to learn word embeddings**: This step is crucial as the foundational task for any NLP model. Learning word embeddings provides the model with an understanding of semantic similarities and differences between words, which is essential before it can comprehend more complex relationships and structures.

2. **Implement an entity-based coherence model using Centering Theory**: After the model has learned basic semantic similarities, introducing an entity-based coherence model focuses on improving local coherence. Centering Theory helps in tracking and maintaining the focus of discourse, especially useful in summarization where maintaining relevant entities through the text is important.

3. **Encode global coherence by parsing the discourse structure using Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST)**: With a foundation in word embeddings and a mechanism for maintaining local coherence through entities, the next logical step is to capture the global coherence by understanding the overall discourse structure. RST provides a framework for this by parsing texts into hierarchically organized components that reflect the logical flow and relationships between different parts of the text.

4. **Fine-tune the model on a summarization-specific dataset**: After the model has been pre-trained and equipped with mechanisms for both local and global coherence, fine-tuning on a task-specific dataset helps adapt the learned embeddings and coherence mechanisms to the specific requirements of summary generation.

5. **Evaluate the model on unseen data**: The final step involves assessing the model's performance, particularly looking at the coherence of generated summaries, to identify areas of improvement or success.

Therefore, the sequence that effectively achieves this integration is:  

A. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

## Correct Answer

A. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

## Reasoning

This sequence logically builds up the model's capability to handle complex notions of coherence, starting with the foundational understanding of word semantics before moving onto entity-based and then global coherence mechanisms. Pre-training on a large corpus ensures the model learns robust word embeddings. Following this, the introduction of local coherence through Centering Theory provides a mechanism to improve focus and continuity in text summarization at a local level. The subsequent encoding of global discourse structures using RST allows the model to understand and generate coherent summaries that logically flow from beginning to end. Fine-tuning and evaluation are practical steps to adapt and assess the model's performance specifically for summary generation tasks, ensuring that the integration of coherence mechanisms effectively enhances the model's summarization capabilities.
