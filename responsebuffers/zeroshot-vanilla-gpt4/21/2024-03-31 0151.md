## Question

Consider a complex Natural Language Processing (NLP) task that requires the analysis and generation of coherent multi-paragraph texts. The system must be capable of understanding and maintaining both local and global coherence throughout the text. Given the advancements in neural representation learning models and their application in various NLP tasks, you decide to employ these models to enhance text coherence. Which of the following approaches would be most effective in ensuring that your system can generate texts with high levels of both local and global coherence?

1. Train a Transformer-based model purely on a large corpus of multi-paragraph texts without explicit coherence modeling.
2. Utilize a hierarchical attention network that models sentences and paragraphs separately to capture different levels of coherence.
3. Implement a sequence-to-sequence model with additional coherence-focused features derived from entity grid representations.
4. Apply a BERT-based model fine-tuned on a dataset annotated with coherence relations such as cause-effect, contrast, and elaboration.
5. Incorporate a graph neural network that models the discourse structure of the text by creating nodes for sentences and edges representing coherence relations between them.

## Solution

To answer this question effectively, it's essential to understand both the concepts of local and global coherence and how different neural representation learning models can address these aspects of text generation.

- **Local coherence** refers to the smooth and logical flow within sentences or between adjacent sentences. It involves the maintenance of consistency and relevance in ideas so that each part of the text connects logically with its immediate neighbors.
  
- **Global coherence**, on the other hand, pertains to the overall structure and unity of the entire text, ensuring that all parts of the text contribute to its central theme or purpose in a meaningful way.

Given the descriptions of the approaches:

1. While Transformer-based models are powerful for capturing complex dependencies in texts, training such a model without explicit coherence modeling may not guarantee high levels of both local and global coherence.

2. Hierarchical attention networks can effectively capture different levels of coherence by modeling sentences and paragraphs separately. This approach is promising for maintaining local coherence within sentences and paragraphs and ensuring that paragraphs contribute to the text's global coherence.

3. Sequence-to-sequence models are good at handling sequence prediction tasks but adding coherence-focused features, such as those derived from entity grid representations, primarily enhances local coherence by ensuring entity consistency and may not directly address global coherence.

4. BERT-based models, especially when fine-tuned on datasets annotated with coherence relations, can understand and generate texts that logically connect through specified relations like cause-effect, contrast, and elaboration. This approach is strong for modeling local coherence and, to some extent, global coherence through explicit relation modeling.

5. Graph neural networks (GNNs) explicitly modeling the discourse structure by creating nodes for sentences and edges representing coherence relations can capture both local and global coherence. This structure allows for the understanding of how sentences (nodes) relate to each other beyond immediate adjacency and contributes to the overall text structure, aligning well with the requirements of global coherence.

Based on the analysis, while options 2, 4, and 5 all offer plausible methods for enhancing coherence, option **5** stands out as it explicitly models both local and global coherence by leveraging the discourse structure through graph neural networks. This approach allows for a nuanced understanding of text structure, ensuring logical flow and unity throughout the text.

## Correct Answer

5. Incorporate a graph neural network that models the discourse structure of the text by creating nodes for sentences and edges representing coherence relations between them.

## Reasoning

The reasoning behind choosing option 5 as the correct answer stems from its direct approach to modeling both local and global coherence through the discourse structure of the text. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are particularly well-suited for this task as they can effectively capture the complex relationships between different parts of the text (represented as nodes and edges). By creating nodes for sentences and edges representing coherence relations between them, a GNN can understand and generate texts where each part logically flows and contributes to the overall theme or purpose, fulfilling the requirements for maintaining high levels of both local and global coherence.
