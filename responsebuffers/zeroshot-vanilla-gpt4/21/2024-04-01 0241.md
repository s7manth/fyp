## Question

Given a set of sentences from a medical research paper abstract, an NLP model is tasked with evaluating the coherence of the abstract. The sentences have been jumbled, and the model must determine the most likely correct order based on principles of discourse structure parsing, centering and entity-based coherence, and global coherence. The sentences are as follows:

A. "This increased survival rate suggests potential for future clinical applications."

B. "In this study, we applied a novel gene therapy to mice with a specific type of cancer."

C. "Further research is needed to examine the long-term effects and possible side effects of this therapy."

D. "The treated mice showed a significantly higher survival rate than the control group."

Which of the following sequences best represents a coherent ordering of the sentences based on natural language processing principles of coherence relations and entity-based coherence?

1. A, B, C, D
2. B, D, A, C
3. D, A, B, C
4. C, B, D, A
5. B, A, D, C

## Solution

The correct sequence should logically and coherently tell the story presented in the abstract, adhering to principles of global coherence, entity-based coherence, and discourse structure. 

1. **Starting Point**: Itâ€™s logical to start with the introduction of the study or the context. Sentence B ("In this study, we applied a novel gene therapy to mice with a specific type of cancer.") serves as an appropriate introduction by establishing the subject and purpose of the research.

2. **Developing the Story with Entity-Based Coherence**: Following the introduction of the study, the narrative should proceed with details about the experiment and its outcomes. Hence, sentence D ("The treated mice showed a significantly higher survival rate than the control group.") naturally follows, discussing the results of applying the novel gene therapy introduced in sentence B.

3. **Expanding on Results**: After detailing the experiment's results, it is logical to discuss the implications or the significance of these results. Sentence A ("This increased survival rate suggests potential for future clinical applications.") expands on the results presented in sentence D by discussing their significance, maintaining entity coherence by referring back to the "increased survival rate."

4. **Concluding with Further Research**: Lastly, the conclusion or call for further study should cap off the abstract. Sentence C ("Further research is needed to examine the long-term effects and possible side effects of this therapy.") serves this purpose by acknowledging the necessity for additional research based on the findings and implications presented earlier.

Therefore, the sequence that follows these principles of discourse structure parsing, centering, and entity-based coherence is B, D, A, C.

## Correct Answer

2. B, D, A, C

## Reasoning

The arrangement B, D, A, C adheres to the natural flow of research communication and narrative storytelling: introducing the study and its purpose (B), presenting the results (D), discussing the significance of these results (A), and highlighting the need for further research (C). This sequence aligns with the concepts of

- **Global Coherence**: The sequence contributes to a globally coherent narrative that logically progresses from introduction to conclusion.
  
- **Centering and Entity-Based Coherence**: The sequence exhibits entity coherence by maintaining focus on the central entities (i.e., the novel gene therapy and the mice) and themes (i.e., survival rate and clinical application) throughout the narrative.
  
- **Discourse Structure Parsing**: By following this order, the sequence aligns with the typical discourse structure of a research paper abstract, which sequentially introduces the study, presents results, interprets these results, and concludes with future directions.

Thus, choice 2 is the correct answer as it satisfies these overarching principles of natural language processing regarding coherence and discourse structure.
