## Question

Consider the task of improving an NLP system's ability to understand complex narrative texts, such as novels or essays, with the goal of enhancing the system's performance in tasks such as summarization, question answering, and text generation. Given the importance of both global coherence and local coherence in understanding narrative structure and flow, you are exploring various approaches to model these concepts effectively. Which of the following approaches is likely to provide the most comprehensive understanding of both global and local coherence within narrative texts?

1. Employing a pre-trained Transformer-based model (e.g., BERT) to generate embeddings for each sentence, followed by a clustering algorithm to identify related clusters of sentences as a means to infer global coherence.
2. Developing a rule-based system that identifies coherence relations (e.g., Cause-Effect, Problem-Solution) between adjacent sentences and uses these relations to build a hierarchical discourse tree, aiming to capture both global and local coherence through the structure of the tree.
3. Utilizing a recurrent neural network (RNN) model with a focus on centering theory, to maintain a coherence structure that tracks the most recurrent entities and their transitions across sentences, aiming to enhance local coherence with lesser emphasis on global coherence.
4. Implementing a representation learning model that combines sentence-level embeddings with document-level embeddings, where the sentence embeddings capture local coherence through their relations and transitions, and the document-level embeddings aim to encapsulate the overall narrative flow and structure, thereby addressing global coherence.
5. Applying a graph-based approach where nodes represent entities or events within the text and edges represent various types of coherence relations (e.g., temporal, causal). The overall connectedness and patterns within the graph aim to reflect both local and global coherence by considering the text as an interrelated set of elements rather than linear sequences.

## Solution

To address the challenge of understanding both global and local coherence in narrative texts comprehensively, one must consider a method that not only captures the relations and connections between adjacent snippets of text (local coherence) but also embraces the overall structure and theme of the narrative (global coherence). 

Approach 1, while powerful in generating contextual embeddings, primarily aids in capturing semantic similarity or relatedness across sentences and may not inherently understand the broader narrative structure or the specific types of coherence relations between sentences, hence it's more suited for local coherence tasks.

Approach 2 relies on identifying specific types of coherence relations and constructing a discourse tree, which is a step towards understanding both the local connections and the overarching structure. However, this method's effectiveness heavily depends on the accuracy and completeness of the rule-based system in identifying coherence relations, which may not be adaptable across different narrative styles or genres.

Approach 3, focusing on centering theory through an RNN model, is designed to enhance local coherence by tracking entities throughout the text. This approach provides an understanding of entity prominence and transitions, which is crucial for local coherence but lacks a direct mechanism for capturing the global narrative structure.

Approach 4 proposes a combined representation learning model that directly targets the challenge at hand. By integrating sentence-level and document-level embeddings, it captures the nuances of local coherence through sentence relations and transitions while simultaneously encapsulating the overall narrative flow and thematic structure through document-level embeddings. This dual focus on both local and global aspects makes it a comprehensive solution for the task.

Approach 5, employing a graph-based method, offers a novel perspective by conceptualizing the narrative as a network of entities and events interlinked through various coherence relations. This approach can potentially capture both local and global coherence by analyzing the interconnectedness and the overarching patterns within the graph. However, the effectiveness of this method hinges on the complexity of constructing and analyzing such a graph, especially for long and complex narratives, which might be more challenging than the integrated embedding approach proposed in Approach 4.

## Correct Answer

4. Implementing a representation learning model that combines sentence-level embeddings with document-level embeddings, where the sentence embeddings capture local coherence through their relations and transitions, and the document-level embeddings aim to encapsulate the overall narrative flow and structure, thereby addressing global coherence.

## Reasoning

The rationale for selecting Approach 4 as the most comprehensive solution for understanding both global and local coherence in narrative texts lies in its integrated modeling of sentence and document-level characteristics. Local coherence is achieved through the detailed analysis of sentence embeddings, which capture the subtle nuances of sentence relations, transitions, and coherence relations. On the other hand, global coherence is addressed through document-level embeddings, which represent the overarching narrative structure, themes, and flow. This dual approach ensures a nuanced understanding of text at both micro and macro levels, making it particularly well-suited for complex narrative texts where both types of coherence play crucial roles in understanding and generating meaningful interpretations.
