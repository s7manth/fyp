## Question
A team of researchers is developing an AI-driven narrative generation system aimed at authoring cohesive short stories. The system needs to ensure both local and global coherence in the narratives it produces. For local coherence, it focuses on the orderly progression of sentences and the logical relationship of events. For global coherence, it ensures that the whole story aligns with a coherent theme or plotline. The team decides to incorporate advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques related to coherence and discourse.

Which combination of techniques and models should the team prioritize to best achieve this goal?

1. Local coherence: Utilize BERT embeddings for sentence representation and apply a rule-based approach for event sequencing. Global coherence: Use an LSTM network to understand the theme and maintain it throughout the narrative.
2. Local coherence: Apply RNN-based sentence embeddings and a Gaussian Mixture Model for event ordering. Global coherence: Implement Topic Modeling (LDA) to extract themes and guide the narrative development.
3. Local coherence: Embed sentences using ELMo and utilize a Conditional Random Field (CRF) for establishing logical event relations. Global coherence: Employ a Transformer-based model fine-tuned on a large narrative dataset for theme consistency.
4. Local coherence: Deploy GPT-3 for generating immediate sentence connections and implement a Markov Decision Process for event progression. Global coherence: Use a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with attention to track and adjust the storyâ€™s theme dynamically.
5. Local coherence: Use FastText embeddings for sentences and a Decision Tree classifier for determining sentence order. Global coherence: Incorporate a Siamese network to compare and adjust the narrative to predefined themes.

## Solution

To address the need for both local and global coherence in narrative generation, we must consider the strengths of various models and techniques in processing and generating text.

### Local Coherence
- For local coherence, the aim is to ensure logical progression and consistency in immediate sentence-to-sentence relationships and event ordering. Advanced embedding techniques like ELMo and Transformer-based models (e.g., GPT-3) provide context-sensitive representations of sentences, capturing nuances that simpler embeddings like BERT, FastText, or RNN-based models might miss. Additionally, for establishing logical event relations and sequencing, models that can handle sequential data and decisions, like Conditional Random Fields (CRF) and Markov Decision Processes, are more suitable than rule-based approaches, Decision Trees, or Gaussian Mixture Models due to their ability to model complex, context-dependent transitions.

### Global Coherence
- For maintaining a theme or plotline throughout a narrative, models capable of understanding larger contexts and retaining information across longer stretches of text are necessary. Transformer-based models and RNNs with attention mechanisms are especially adept at this, as they can handle long-range dependencies and dynamically adjust to thematic elements. Topic Modeling (LDA) and Siamese networks might offer thematic insights or comparisons but lack the dynamic, context-aware generation and adjustment capabilities provided by the aforementioned models.

Hence, the most effective combination for achieving both local and global coherence in a narrative generation system would involve:

- **Local coherence**: Embed sentences using context-aware, sophisticated embeddings like ELMo, paired with a CRF for sequencing, due to their strong performance in capturing nuanced, context-sensitive information and managing complex event relations.
- **Global coherence**: Employ a Transformer-based model fine-tuned on narrative data, which are state-of-the-art in handling long-range dependencies and maintaining thematic consistency across a lengthy text.

**Choice 3** is the most suitable option, combining ELMo embeddings and CRF for local coherence with a Transformer-based model for global coherence.

## Correct Answer

3. Local coherence: Embed sentences using ELMo and utilize a Conditional Random Field (CRF) for establishing logical event relations. Global coherence: Employ a Transformer-based model fine-tuned on a large narrative dataset for theme consistency.

## Reasoning

The reasoning behind selecting choice 3 is twofold:

1. **Local Coherence**: ELMo provides deep, context-dependent representations that capture nuances in meanings across different sentences, making it an excellent choice for understanding the intricate details necessary for local coherence. Coupled with a CRF, the system can effectively model the sequential relationship between events, allowing for a nuanced and contextually aware approach to establishing logical event sequences.
  
2. **Global Coherence**: Transformer-based models are known for their ability to grasp long-range dependencies and maintain consistency across large blocks of text. Fine-tuning such a model on a narrative dataset ensures that it can generate text that adheres to a thematic structure, thus maintaining global coherence throughout the story. This combination addresses both the needs for detailed, local connections between events and sentences, and the overarching requirement for thematic consistency, ensuring the generated narratives are both locally and globally coherent.
