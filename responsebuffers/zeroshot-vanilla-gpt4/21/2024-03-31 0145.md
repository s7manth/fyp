## Question

Consider an advanced natural language processing task where you are developing an automated story generation system. The goal is for the system to not only generate grammatically correct sentences but also ensure that the narrative is coherent both locally and globally. Your approach involves using a mix of representation learning models for local coherence and techniques to ensure global narrative coherence. Based on your understanding of coherence relations, discourse structure parsing, centering and entity-based coherence, representation learning models for local coherence, and global coherence, which of the following strategies would likely be the most effective in improving the coherence of the generated stories?

1. Implementing a sequence-to-sequence model that uses LSTM units to maintain subject continuity across sentences, reinforcing centering theory principles for local coherence.
2. Employing a hierarchical attention network that focuses on sentence-level and paragraph-level representations, combining the benefits of entity-based coherence for local narrative parts and global coherence across the whole story.
3. Utilizing a GPT-3 model fine-tuned on a dataset of coherent stories, ensuring the generated narratives follow patterns of coherence observed in human-written stories without explicitly modeling any coherence relations or structures.
4. Integrating a discourse structure parser like RST (Rhetorical Structure Theory) parser to explicitly model discourse relations across the narrative and enforce coherence by adjusting the generation based on parsed structures.
5. Applying a combination of techniques: an RST parser for modeling discourse structure, a Transformer-based model capturing long-range dependencies for global coherence, and a reinforcement learning layer that rewards generation of entity-centric sentences, enhancing both local and global coherence.

## Solution

The question requires an understanding of various coherence models and their application in natural language processing, particularly in the context of story generation. Here's a thought process and reasoning for each choice:

1. **Sequence-to-sequence model with LSTM units:** While LSTMs are good at maintaining information over sequences and can somewhat preserve subject continuity (following the principles of centering theory), they might not be sufficient for ensuring global narrative coherence. This approach focuses more on local coherence without explicitly tackling the narrative structure on a global scale.
   
2. **Hierarchical attention network:** This model takes into account different levels of narrative (sentences and paragraphs) which is a step toward ensuring both local and global coherence. However, while it might improve coherence, it does not explicitly model coherence relations or deeply understand narrative structure beyond these levels.

3. **GPT-3 model fine-tuned on coherent stories:** While pre-trained models like GPT-3 are capable of generating text that is locally and globally coherent to a degree, this approach relies heavily on the model's general ability to mimic the coherence patterns it has seen during training. It doesn't incorporate an explicit understanding or modeling of coherence relations or narrative structures.

4. **RST parser for discourse structure:** RST parser explicitly models discourse relations, which can significantly improve the structural coherence of the narrative. However, this approach might still lack in ensuring local coherence at the sentence level or capturing entity-based coherence without additional mechanisms.

5. **Combination of techniques (RST parser, Transformer model, reinforcement learning layer):** This approach is comprehensive as it explicitly models discourse structure for global coherence, uses Transformer models for capturing long-range dependencies within the narrative, and enhances local coherence through entity-centric sentence generation rewarded by reinforcement learning. This combination addresses various aspects of coherence, making it a robust solution for the task.

## Correct Answer

5. Applying a combination of techniques: an RST parser for modeling discourse structure, a Transformer-based model capturing long-range dependencies for global coherence, and a reinforcement learning layer that rewards generation of entity-centric sentences, enhancing both local and global coherence.

## Reasoning

The reasoning behind selecting option 5 as the correct answer stems from its comprehensive approach to ensuring both local and global coherence. By incorporating a discourse structure parser (like RST), the system can explicitly model and enforce coherence on a structural level, aligning with the best practices in discourse structure parsing and global coherence management. The addition of a Transformer-based model allows capturing long-range dependencies in the narrative, which helps in maintaining global coherence by recognizing and maintaining narrative threads across the story. Finally, the reinforcement learning layer focused on rewarding the generation of entity-centric sentences ties into entity-based coherence principles, ensuring that the narrative maintains focus and continuity around key entities, crucial for local coherence. This multifaceted approach is in line with advanced NLP concepts and provides a robust framework for generating coherent stories.
