## Question
Suppose you are given a task to develop a model for assessing the global coherence of multi-paragraph essays automatically. Your approach involves leveraging the latest advancements in representation learning models along with traditional coherence and discourse structure principles. Given this context, which of the following model architectures and pre-processing steps would likely be most effective for capturing both local and global coherence in multi-paragraph essays?

1. A CNN-based model applied directly to the raw text of essays to capture semantic and syntactic patterns significant for coherence, without specific pre-processing steps aimed at discourse structure.
2. An LSTM network that processes sentences sequentially with additional sentence position embeddings to capture the narrative flow, preceded by parsing each essay into a discourse tree using a rule-based discourse parser.
3. A Transformer-based model fine-tuned on a dataset of well-structured vs. poorly structured essays, incorporating a pre-training step where paragraphs are shuffled to make the model sensitive to paragraph order.
4. A BERT-based model where each paragraph is encoded separately and then fed into a hierarchical attention network to integrate paragraph-level representations into a global essay-level coherence score.
5. An ensemble of shallow machine learning models (e.g., SVM, Random Forest) applied to hand-crafted features extracted from the text, including entity transitions, pronoun resolution stats, and cue phrase counts, without leveraging deep learning semantic representations.

## Solution

### Correct Answer
3. A Transformer-based model fine-tuned on a dataset of well-structured vs. poorly structured essays, incorporating a pre-training step where paragraphs are shuffled to make the model sensitive to paragraph order.

### Reasoning
To assess global coherence effectively, a model must understand both the semantic content of individual sentences and paragraphs and how these elements link together to form a coherent whole. This task involves capturing hierarchical structures of discourse, understanding thematic progression, and recognizing how entities and topics are introduced, developed, and referenced throughout the text. 

- **Option 1 (CNN-based model):** Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are effective for capturing local patterns within data, such as identifying syntactic and semantic features in text. However, CNNs are less adept at modeling long-range dependencies and understanding the global structure of a text, which is crucial for assessing global coherence.

- **Option 2 (LSTM with position embeddings):** Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks can capture sequential data and have been used effectively for tasks requiring an understanding of temporal or sequence-based data. The addition of sentence position embeddings could help the model recognize narrative flow. However, LSTMs may struggle with very long texts due to limitations in memory and processing long-range dependencies, a critical factor in multi-paragraph essays.

- **Option 3 (Transformer-based model):** Transformers are designed to handle sequences of data while effectively managing long-range dependencies between elements in the sequence. The pre-training step of shuffling paragraphs forces the model to learn features related to the order and structure of paragraphs, directly targeting the task of assessing global coherence. This approach leverages the strengths of Transformers in handling sequences and their capacity for representing complex relationships within data, making it the most suitable choice.

- **Option 4 (BERT with hierarchical attention):** While encoding paragraphs separately with BERT and then aggregating them using a hierarchical attention network could capture some aspects of both local and global coherence, this strategy may not fully exploit the sequential and hierarchical nature of discourse in multi-paragraph essays. It focuses more on integrating paragraph-level representations rather than understanding the global structure and flow.

- **Option 5 (Ensemble of shallow models):** Shallow machine learning models with hand-crafted features can capture certain elements of coherence, such as entity transitions and cue phrase usage. However, compared to deep learning approaches, they are less capable of understanding the nuanced and complex patterns of language use that contribute to global coherence in texts.

Therefore, the Transformer-based model with a pre-training step designed to make the model sensitive to paragraph order (option 3) presents the most effective approach. It leverages advanced representation learning to capture both the semantic content and the structural coherence in essays, addressing the challenge at multiple levels of analysis.
