## Question
A research team is designing a machine translation system using RNNs. They want to ensure the system effectively handles long-range dependencies, a common issue with languages having different word orders. After implementing an encoder-decoder architecture with basic RNNs, they notice significant performance issues with sentences longer than 15 words. To address this, they consider different architectural enhancements. Which of the following modifications is most likely to improve the system's performance on long sentences by addressing the vanishing gradient problem and enhancing the model's ability to capture long-range dependencies?

1. Replacing the RNN layers in both the encoder and decoder with CNN layers.
2. Replacing the encoder RNN with a stack of LSTM layers and keeping the decoder as a simple RNN.
3. Increasing the hidden state dimensionality of the RNN layers in both the encoder and decoder.
4. Implementing attention mechanisms on top of the existing encoder-decoder architecture.
5. Adding more RNN layers to both the encoder and decoder to increase the model's depth.

## Solution

To solve this question effectively, we need to understand the limitations of basic RNNs, especially regarding long-range dependencies and the vanishing gradient problem. Each option must be evaluated in light of these considerations:

1. **CNN Layers**: CNNs are effective for capturing hierarchical spatial features in image processing and have been used in sequence processing. However, they do not inherently address the vanishing gradient problem or specialize in capturing long-range dependencies in sequence data.

2. **Stack of LSTM Layers for the Encoder**: LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory networks) are specifically designed to address the vanishing gradient problem through their gated mechanisms. They can maintain information over longer sequences effectively, making them well-suited for tasks requiring an understanding of long-range dependencies.

3. **Increasing Hidden State Dimensionality**: While increasing the dimensionality of the hidden states can enhance the model's capacity (i.e., its ability to represent more complex functions or relationships), it does not directly address the fundamental issue of vanishing gradients that affects learning long-range dependencies.

4. **Attention Mechanisms**: Attention mechanisms allow a model to focus on different parts of the input sequence when predicting each word of the output sequence, effectively creating shortcuts between distant positions. This can significantly improve the handling of long-range dependencies but does not directly address the vanishing gradient problem in RNNs.

5. **Adding More RNN Layers**: Increasing model depth by adding more RNN layers can theoretically improve the model's capacity. However, it might exacerbate the vanishing gradient problem, making it even harder for the model to learn long-range dependencies.

Given these considerations, **Option 2** is most likely to improve performance on long sentences by directly addressing the vanishing gradient problem through the use of LSTMs, which are known for their ability to manage long-range dependencies. While Option 4 is also a suitable approach for dealing with long-range dependencies, it doesn't address the vanishing gradient problem inherent to RNNs. Therefore, Option 2 is the best answer because it tackles the core issue impacting the performance on long sentences.

## Correct Answer

2. Replacing the encoder RNN with a stack of LSTM layers and keeping the decoder as a simple RNN.

## Reasoning

The motivation behind choosing LSTM layers specifically for the encoder is grounded in addressing the vanishing gradient problem, which is critical when dealing with long-range dependencies. LSTMs maintain a cell state alongside the hidden state, allowing them to regulate the flow of information and mitigate the effects of vanishing gradients through gated structures (input, output, and forget gates). This makes LSTMs particularly suitable for capturing dependencies over longer sequences without losing significant information, thus improving the machine translation system's ability to handle languages with different word orders and long sentences.
