## Question
In a recent project, you are tasked with enhancing a machine translation system. Your goal is to improve its ability to capture long-range dependencies in complex sentences, a challenge the current architecture struggles with. Previously, the system utilized a basic RNN architecture for both its encoder and decoder components. Based on your knowledge of advanced RNN architectures and their properties, which of the following modifications would most effectively address the issue of capturing long-range dependencies in sentence structures for machine translation?

1. Replacing the basic RNN layers with Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) layers in both the encoder and decoder.
2. Implementing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in the encoder while keeping the basic RNN in the decoder.
3. Adding more layers of basic RNNs in both the encoder and decoder, effectively deepening the network.
4. Introducing an attention mechanism along with using LSTM units in both encoder and decoder.
5. Utilizing a Transformer model, entirely replacing the need for RNNs in both encoder and decoder components.

## Solution
To address the issue of capturing long-range dependencies in complex sentences for machine translation, we need an architecture that can effectively manage the vanishing gradient problem and retain information over longer sequences. This requirement rules out options that solely rely on basic RNNs due to their known difficulty in learning long-range dependencies. Let's evaluate the options:

1. **GRU layers**: GRUs are an improvement over basic RNNs as they can better capture dependencies for medium-length sequences through their gating mechanisms. However, they might still struggle with very long-range dependencies compared to other more advanced options.

2. **CNN in the encoder**: CNNs are primarily known for their success in handling spatial data in image processing and have limited capabilities in processing sequential data, especially for capturing long-range dependencies in text.

3. **Deepening the network with more RNN layers**: While adding more layers can increase the model's capacity, basic RNNs, even when stacked, are fundamentally limited in their ability to handle long-range dependencies due to the vanishing gradient problem.

4. **Adding attention with LSTM units**: LSTMs are designed to address the vanishing gradient problem, making them inherently better at capturing long-range dependencies compared to basic RNNs. The introduction of an attention mechanism significantly enhances this capacity by allowing the decoder to focus on different parts of the input sequence for each step of the output sequence, directly addressing the challenge of long-range dependencies in complex sentences.

5. **Using a Transformer model**: Transformers eliminate recurrence altogether and rely on attention mechanisms to capture global dependencies, potentially offering a robust solution for machine translation. However, this option completely removes RNNs, which may not be the direct evolutionary step intended for enhancing the existing RNN-based architecture.

Given these considerations, **option 4** - introducing an attention mechanism along with using LSTM units in both encoder and decoder is the most effective and direct upgrade to the existing system that targets the specific challenge of capturing long-range dependencies in sentence structures for machine translation, while still building upon the RNN architectural foundation.

## Correct Answer
4. Introducing an attention mechanism along with using LSTM units in both encoder and decoder.

## Reasoning
LSTMs are specifically designed to overcome the limitations of basic RNNs by efficiently capturing long-term dependencies through their unique gating mechanisms, including the forget gate, input gate, and output gate. These mechanisms allow LSTMs to learn what information to store, update, and discard over long sequences, significantly mitigating the vanishing gradient problem. 

The addition of an attention mechanism further enhances the model's ability to focus on specific parts of the input sequence when producing each word of the translation, allowing it to capture nuances in meaning that stem from long-range dependencies in the input text. This combination addresses the core issue of the existing system's struggles with complex sentences, making it a highly suitable solution for the project's goal.
