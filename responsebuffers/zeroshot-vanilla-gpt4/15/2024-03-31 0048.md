## Question

Given a sentence "The robot planned a path that avoided obstacles," you are developing a span-based neural constituency parser. During the parsing process, you employ a score function that evaluates each potential subtree based on both its intrinsic properties and its compatibility with the context in which it appears. Considering the advancements in contextual word embeddings, you decide to incorporate BERT embeddings as part of your scoring function to improve the parser's understanding of context within the sentence.

Which of the following best describes how incorporating BERT embeddings might affect the parsing process, especially in distinguishing the function of "that" as a relative pronoun introducing a relative clause vs. a conjunction introducing a nominal clause?

1. It would have no significant effect because constituency parsing fundamentally relies on syntax rather than semantics.
2. It significantly improves the parser's accuracy in identifying the structure of the sentence by leveraging contextual embeddings, which provide deep semantic insights that are absent in traditional parsing models.
3. It might improve the performance slightly by providing additional context, but traditional feature-based methods would still primarily drive the parsing decisions.
4. Incorporating BERT embeddings would only be useful for resolving semantic ambiguities, not syntactic ones, making it irrelevant for distinguishing different functions of "that."
5. It could introduce too much noise into the parsing process, as BERT embeddings are optimized for tasks related to understanding word meaning in context, not for syntactic parsing.

## Solution

To solve this question, it's critical to understand the role of contextual embeddings like those provided by BERT in a parsing task and how they can contribute to resolving syntactic ambiguities that are also informed by semantics.

BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) provides deep contextual word embeddings by considering both the left and the right context of each word in a sentence. This characteristic makes BERT particularly adept at understanding the role and meaning of words in context. 

In the sentence given, "that" could function as a relative pronoun introducing a relative clause ("a path that avoided obstacles") or theoretically as a conjunction introducing a nominal clause in different contexts (not applicable in this specific sentence, but important for distinguishing capabilities in general). The ambiguity here is syntactic but closely tied to semantic understanding because recognizing "that" as introducing a relative clause helps determine the overall sentence structure and meaning.

Incorporating BERT embeddings into the scoring function of a span-based neural constituency parser would provide it with a nuanced understanding of each word's role within the broader sentence context. This semantic insight, when used alongside traditional syntactic parsing techniques, can significantly enhance the parser's ability to accurately determine the structure of complex sentences where syntactic cues might alone be ambiguous or subtle.

Therefore, the answer would highlight the benefits of using BERT embeddings for improving the parsing accuracy in cases where contextual understanding informs syntactic structure differentiation.

## Correct Answer

2. It significantly improves the parser's accuracy in identifying the structure of the sentence by leveraging contextual embeddings, which provide deep semantic insights that are absent in traditional parsing models.

## Reasoning

The reasoning behind the correct answer lies in the acknowledgment of the intertwined nature of syntax and semantics in natural language understanding. Traditional syntactic parsing methods, while powerful, can sometimes fall short in resolving ambiguities that are semantically informed. The introduction of BERT embeddings into the scoring function of a constituency parser isn't merely about adding more data; it's about enriching the parser's decision-making process with deep, bidirectional contextual insights that are uniquely possible thanks to advances in neural embeddings.

This addition allows the parser to consider not just the static form of the words and their direct syntactic relationships but also the dynamic, context-informed roles these words play within the sentence. Given that the sentence "The robot planned a path that avoided obstacles" involves distinguishing "that" as a relative pronoun—where its function and the structure it introduces hinge on both syntactic and semantic cues—incorporating BERT's deep contextual insights significantly enhances the parser's ability to resolve such ambiguities accurately.

Therefore, incorporating BERT embeddings marks a significant improvement in parsing accuracy by bridging the gap between syntactic structure and semantic meaning, especially in complex sentences where traditional parsing methods may falter.
