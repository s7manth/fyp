## Question
Given a sentence "The cat sat on the mat." and a simple context-free grammar (CFG) designed to parse English sentences:

1. S → NP VP  
2. NP → Det N  
3. VP → V NP  
4. Det → "the"  
5. N → "cat" | "mat"  
6. V → "sat"  
7. P → "on"  
8. PP → P NP  
9. VP → VP PP  

The task is to perform CKY parsing on the given sentence using the provided CFG. After parsing, identify which of the following trees correctly represents the parse tree of that sentence according to the CFG rules:

1. S → NP VP → Det N V NP → "The cat sat on the mat."
2. S → NP VP → Det N V NP PP → "The cat sat on the mat."
3. S → NP VP → Det N VP → V NP PP → "The cat sat on the mat."
4. S → NP VP → VP PP → V Det N → "The cat sat on the mat."
5. S → NP VP → Det N VP → V NP → NP PP → "The cat sat on the mat."

## Solution

Step 1: Understand the grammar rules and the sentence structure. The grammar given is suitable for simple English sentences with a structure that includes determiners (Det), nouns (N), verbs (V), prepositions (P), noun phrases (NP), verb phrases (VP), and prepositional phrases (PP). 

Step 2: Start with applying the rules that match the individual words in the sentence to their corresponding grammar categories:
- "The" matches Det (Rule 4)
- "cat" and "mat" match N (Rule 5)
- "sat" matches V (Rule 6)
- "on" matches P (Rule 7)

Step 3: Build phrases from words by applying the CFG rules.
- Det N forms NP (Rule 2), applying this will give us two NPs: "The cat", "The mat"
- V NP forms VP (Rule 3), but we don't have an NP that follows "sat" directly. We need a rule that combines a verb phrase with a prepositional phrase.
- P NP forms PP (Rule 8), applying this with "on" and "The mat" gives us: "on the mat"
- VP PP forms an extended VP (Rule 9), "sat on the mat" fits this rule, but we need to connect it with "The cat".

Step 4: Putting it all together,
- We have an NP "The cat" from Step 3.
- We need to form a VP that includes "sat on the mat" to match the sentence structure. Here, "sat" is V, and "on the mat" is PP, forming VP by Rule 9.
- Connect NP and the extended VP to form the sentence (S).

Understanding these steps, the correct tree structure that represents the given sentence according to the CFG rules and CKY parsing should be:

S → NP VP  
  |      |  
NP VP  
|    |  
Det N VP  
|     |     |  
"The cat"   V     NP  
                |      |  
                "sat" PP  
                            |  
                            P NP  
                            |     |  
                           "on" Det N  
                                      |     |  
                                     "the mat"  

This corresponds to the option:

5. S → NP VP → Det N VP → V NP → NP PP → "The cat sat on the mat."

## Correct Answer
5. S → NP VP → Det N VP → V NP → NP PP → "The cat sat on the mat."

## Reasoning
The solution process entails starting with categorizing individual words according to the CFG, then sequentially applying CFG rules to build up the phrase structure. Here we need a combination that allows for a verb phrase (VP) to be extended with a prepositional phrase (PP), then combine it with a noun phrase (NP) to form the complete sentence (S). Considering the structure of the sentence "The cat sat on the mat." and how CFG rules apply through CKY parsing, option 5 correctly constructs the phrase structure, fulfilling the CFG rules and accurately representing the parse tree for the given sentence.
