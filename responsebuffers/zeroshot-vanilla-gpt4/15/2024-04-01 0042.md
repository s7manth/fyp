## Question
Given a sentence "The young girl saw the man with the telescope", which of the following parse trees generated by a context-free grammar (CFG) correctly captures the ambiguity present due to the prepositional phrase "with the telescope"? Assume that NP stands for Noun Phrase, VP for Verb Phrase, PP for Prepositional Phrase, DT for Determiner, NN for Noun, VBD for Past-Tense Verb, JJ for Adjective, and IN for Preposition.

1. (S (NP (DT The) (JJ young) (NN girl)) (VP (VBD saw) (NP (DT the) (NN man) (PP (IN with) (NP (DT the) (NN telescope))))))
2. (S (NP (DT The) (JJ young) (NN girl)) (VP (VBD saw) (NP (DT the) (NN man))) (PP (IN with) (NP (DT the) (NN telescope))))
3. Both 1 and 2
4. (S (VP (VBD saw) (NP (DT The) (JJ young) (NN girl) (PP (IN with) (NP (DT the) (NN man)))) (NP (DT the) (NN telescope))))
5. None of the above

## Solution

The sentence "The young girl saw the man with the telescope" can be interpreted in two ways due to the ambiguity of the prepositional phrase "with the telescope". It can either mean that the young girl used a telescope to see the man (the telescope is associated with the verb "saw"), or it can mean that the girl saw a man who had a telescope (the telescope is associated with the man).

Option 1: presents a parse tree where the prepositional phrase "with the telescope" modifies "the man", suggesting that the man had the telescope.
$$\text{(S (NP (DT The) (JJ young) (NN girl)) (VP (VBD saw) (NP (DT the) (NN man) (PP (IN with) (NP (DT the) (NN telescope)))))}$$

Option 2: presents a parse tree where the prepositional phrase "with the telescope" is at the same level as the verb phrase, thus modifying the action of seeing, suggesting that "the young girl" used a telescope to see the man.
$$\text{(S (NP (DT The) (JJ young) (NN girl)) (VP (VBD saw) (NP (DT the) (NN man))) (PP (IN with) (NP (DT the) (NN telescope))))}$$

To correctly capture the ambiguity present in the sentence, both interpretations should be considered valid.

Option 3 says that both 1 and 2 correctly capture the ambiguity, which is the correct answer since it acknowledges both possible interpretations of the sentence.

Option 4 does not correctly represent any valid interpretation of the sentence, as it incorrectly nestles the elements of the sentence and does not clearly resolve the ambiguity regarding the prepositional phrase.

Option 5, "None of the above", is incorrect because options 1 and 2 each correctly represent one of the ambiguous interpretations of the sentence.

## Correct Answer
3. Both 1 and 2

## Reasoning
The sentence "The young girl saw the man with the telescope" is ambiguous because the prepositional phrase "with the telescope" can be associated with either the act of seeing (implying the girl is using a telescope) or with the man (implying the man possesses the telescope). This ambiguity is perfectly captured by having two parse trees: one where the PP modifies the noun phrase related to the man (Option 1), and another where the PP modifies the entire verb phrase, implying it's part of the action of seeing (Option 2). Thus, acknowledging both trees as valid interpretations respects the sentence's inherent ambiguity, making Option 3 the most comprehensive and accurate choice.
