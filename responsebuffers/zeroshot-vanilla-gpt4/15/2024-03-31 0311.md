## Question
In constituency parsing, the CKY (Cocke-Kasami-Younger) algorithm is often used due to its efficiency and effectiveness in dealing with context-free grammars (CFGs). Given a sentence "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog", and assuming a simplified CFG that generates this sentence, which of the following statements is correct about applying the CKY algorithm to this sentence for parsing?

1. The CKY algorithm requires the CFG to be converted into Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) because it can only handle binary branching in the parse tree.
2. The CKY algorithm inherently resolves all forms of ambiguity in natural language by selecting the most probable parse tree based on predefined probabilities assigned to each rule in the CFG.
3. Span-based neural constituency parsing models, being an advancement over CKY, do not require the CFG to be transformed into any normal form for parsing to be conducted.
4. The algorithm can directly parse any given CFG without modifications, including those that have unary branches or more than two non-terminals on the right-hand side of their production rules.
5. Evaluating the performance of the CKY algorithm on this sentence would involve comparing the generated parse tree with that of a treebank's annotated parse tree for the same sentence to measure precision and recall.

## Solution
The CKY algorithm is a dynamic programming algorithm used in natural language processing for parsing sentences in a context-free grammar. The key points to consider for this question consist of the requirements for the algorithm, how it handles ambiguity, the comparison between older parsing methods and newer neural models, and how its performance is evaluated.

**Point 1:** The CKY algorithm indeed requires the CFG to be converted into Chomsky Normal Form (CNF). This is because the algorithm is designed to work with rules that have either two non-terminals or one terminal on the right-hand side, facilitating binary branching in the parse trees. Therefore, any CFG has to be transformed into CNF before the CKY algorithm can be applied.

**Point 2:** While the CKY algorithm can parse sentences given a CFG, it does not inherently resolve ambiguity. Ambiguity resolution in parsing usually requires probabilistic parsing methods, such as those used in probabilistic CKY parsing, where probabilities are assigned to grammar rules.

**Point 3:** Span-based neural constituency parsers often bypass explicit CFG and CNF conversion by learning to predict tree structures directly from data. However, this doesn't apply to the traditional CKY algorithm which has specific requirements regarding the form of CFG it parses.

**Point 4:** As noted before, the CKY algorithm cannot directly parse any given CFG without modifications. It specifically requires the grammar to be in CNF to ensure the parse tree is binary branching.

**Point 5:** Evaluating the performance of parsing algorithms, including the CKY algorithm, involves comparing the parsed output with reference parse trees, often found in treebanks. Precision and recall metrics, among others, are used to assess how well the algorithm performed in identifying the correct tree structure of sentences.

Therefore, based on the detailed analysis above:

## Correct Answer
1. The CKY algorithm requires the CFG to be converted into Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) because it can only handle binary branching in the parse tree.

## Reasoning
The CKY algorithm's requirement for CFGs to be in CNF is fundamental to its design, allowing it to efficiently parse sentences using dynamic programming. This transformation is necessary to ensure that the parse trees generated have a uniform binary structure, which is crucial for the algorithm's operation. The algorithm does not, on its own, solve ambiguity without additional probabilistic mechanisms, and it cannot parse CFGs that are not in CNF directly. While evaluating its performance, comparing the output with annotated treebanks indeed helps in assessing its accuracy through precision and recall, but this doesn't reflect on the algorithm's inherent operational requirements and constraints, making the correct answer the need for CFGs to be transformed into CNF.
