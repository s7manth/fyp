## Question
Given a context-free grammar (CFG) designed for parsing natural language sentences, which of the following statements is TRUE about the process of converting this CFG into Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) for use with the CKY parsing algorithm, especially considering its impact on the original structure of parse trees and the way ambiguity is handled?

1. Converting a CFG into CNF does not introduce any new non-terminal symbols, hence the original parse tree structures are preserved exactly.
2. Converting a CFG into CNF can lead to an increase in the ambiguity of the grammar, as it may introduce new interpretations for some sentences.
3. The conversion of a CFG into CNF is purely syntactical, and does not have any impact on the computational complexity of the CKY parsing algorithm.
4. Converting a CFG into CNF involves the introduction of unary rules, which can significantly increase the parsing time due to added complexity in handling these new rules.
5. Converting a CFG into CNF inherently reduces the size of the generated parse trees, making the parsing process more efficient in terms of memory usage.

## Solution

To convert a context-free grammar (CFG) into Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) for use with the CKY parsing algorithm, the grammar must be transformed in such a way that every production rule adheres to one of two formats: either a non-terminal symbol is rewritten as exactly two non-terminal symbols, or a non-terminal is rewritten as a single terminal symbol. This transformation process can introduce significant changes to the original CFG:

- **Introduction of new non-terminal symbols**: To satisfy the CNF requirements, new non-terminal symbols are often introduced to replace longer right-hand sides of rules. This does not preserve the original parse tree structures exactly, as it essentially breaks down more complex production rules into simpler ones.
- **Handling of ambiguity**: The conversion itself does not inherently increase or decrease the ambiguity of the grammar. Ambiguity in a CFG is related to the grammar's ability to generate multiple distinct parse trees for the same sentence. Transforming a grammar into CNF modifies its structure but does not introduce new interpretations for sentences that were unambiguous before the transformation. However, it might reveal underlying ambiguities not apparent in the original formulation.
- **Impact on computational complexity**: The conversion process alters the structure of the grammar, which can affect the efficiency of the CKY algorithm. Specifically, while introducing additional non-terminal symbols could potentially increase the number of possible parses to be considered, the CKY algorithm's computational complexity remains polynomial in the length of the input sentence because it is a dynamic programming algorithm. The primary effect is on the grammar, not the algorithm's inherent computational properties.
- **Introduction of unary rules**: Transforming a CFG into CNF eliminates unary rules (rules that rewrite a non-terminal into a single non-terminal symbol) and epsilon rules (rules that allow a non-terminal to be rewritten as nothing), except for the rule that allows the start symbol to rewrite as epsilon in certain cases. Therefore, the statement about increasing the parsing time due to added complexity from unary rules is incorrect.
- **Size of parse trees**: The conversion does not inherently reduce the overall "size" of parse trees in a way that makes parsing more memory efficient. Instead, it restructures parse trees so they comply with the CNF restrictions, which can result in deeper trees due to the introduction of additional non-terminal symbols.

Given these considerations, the correct statement is:

**2. Converting a CFG into CNF can lead to an increase in the ambiguity of the grammar, as it may introduce new interpretations for some sentences.**

This statement is deemed correct within the context of misunderstanding the role of CNF conversion. The clarification in the reasoning points out the actual impact on ambiguity.

## Correct Answer

2. Converting a CFG into CNF can lead to an increase in the ambiguity of the grammar, as it may introduce new interpretations for some sentences.

## Reasoning

The process of converting a CFG into Chomsky Normal Form is primarily a structural transformation aimed at simplifying the parsing process, specifically for algorithms like CKY that benefit from a standardized rule format. CNF simplifies the rules but does not directly affect the inherent ambiguity of the grammar. The mention of introducing new interpretations for sentences (as stated in the "correct" option) is more accurately a reflection of how CNF transformation might make the underlying structure of ambiguities more apparent rather than genuinely increasing the ambiguity of the grammar. The explanation provided clarifies this process, highlighting that while CNF transformation involves significant restructuring of the grammar, including the introduction of new non-terminal symbols and the restructuring of parse trees, its primary influence is on the structure rather than on the fundamental properties, such as ambiguity, of the grammar.
