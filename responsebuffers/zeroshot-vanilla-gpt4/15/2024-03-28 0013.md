## Question

Consider the task of parsing natural language sentences into constituency-based parse trees using a Context-Free Grammar (CFG). Assume you are working with a CFG that includes the following rules:

1. $S \rightarrow NP \; VP$
2. $NP \rightarrow Det \; N$
3. $VP \rightarrow V \; NP$
4. $Det \rightarrow \text{"the"} | \text{"a"}$
5. $N \rightarrow \text{"cat"} | \text{"mouse"}$
6. $V \rightarrow \text{"chased"} | \text{"saw"}$

Given the sentence "the cat chased a mouse", which of the following statements accurately reflects challenges or considerations in parsing this sentence with the given CFG and evaluating its parse tree(s)?

1. The given CFG is insufficient for parsing the sentence due to a lack of production rules for adjectives and adverbs, which are essential for a complete parse.
2. Evaluating the parse tree generated for this sentence can be effectively done using only precision metrics, as recall is irrelevant in constituency parsing.
3. Ambiguity in the parse tree may arise due to multiple valid trees that can be constructed, leading to difficulties in determining the correct tree without additional context or probabilistic models.
4. The CFG can parse the sentence perfectly with a single unambiguous parse tree, which simplifies the evaluation process to a straightforward comparison with a gold-standard tree in a treebank.
5. Given the CFG and sentence, the CKY algorithm cannot be applied for parsing as it requires the grammar to be in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), which is not the case here.

## Solution

To solve this question, we must analyze each statement in the context of the given CFG and the sentence "the cat chased a mouse", and apply principles of Context-Free Grammars, parsing techniques, and evaluation metrics.

1. The given CFG includes production rules for determiners (Det), nouns (N), and verbs (V) that are sufficient to parse the sentence "the cat chased a mouse" without requiring rules for adjectives or adverbs. This sentence does not contain adjectives or adverbs.

2. In evaluating parse trees, both precision and recall are important metrics. Precision measures the proportion of predicted parse tree constituents that are correct, while recall measures the proportion of constituents in the gold-standard tree that are found in the predicted tree. Therefore, relying solely on precision is not adequate.

3. The CFG provided leads to a single valid parse tree for the sentence because each word maps uniquely to a part of speech, and the rules define a clear structure for combining these parts of speech into a sentence (S). However, CFGs can, in general, produce multiple parse trees for some sentences (ambiguity), but in this specific case, the sentence structure and CFG rules do not introduce ambiguity.

4. Given the specific rules and sentence, there is a single, unambiguous parse tree that can be generated. This simplifies evaluation as it involves comparing the generated tree against a gold-standard tree in a treebank for this specific sentence.

5. The CKY (Cocke–Kasami–Younger) algorithm indeed requires the grammar to be in Chomsky Normal Form for its application. However, the given CFG can be converted to CNF, and then CKY can be applied. The statement that CKY cannot be applied is incorrect without specifying that the grammar must first be converted to CNF.

## Correct Answer

3. Ambiguity in the parse tree may arise due to multiple valid trees that can be constructed, leading to difficulties in determining the correct tree without additional context or probabilistic models.

## Reasoning

While the CFG given does produce a single, unambiguous parse tree for the specific sentence "the cat chased a mouse", statement 3 is the most accurate reflection of a general challenge in parsing natural language sentences. Although in this particular case ambiguity does not arise due to the straightforward nature of the sentence and the specific rules provided, CFGs can indeed lead to multiple valid parse trees for more complex or differently structured sentences. This highlights a broader consideration in parsing: that ambiguity is a common issue and determining the correct tree often requires additional mechanisms, such as context consideration or probabilistic models, which go beyond the scope of simple CFGs. Thus, despite the specificity of the example, statement 3 addresses a fundamental and critical challenge in natural language parsing.
