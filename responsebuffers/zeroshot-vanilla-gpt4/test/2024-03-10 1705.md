## Question

Given a corpus of text documents in English, you are tasked with developing a preprocessing pipeline that normalizes the text for a subsequent information retrieval system. The system should be robust in handling different morphological forms of words to ensure that variations of a word do not affect the retrieval process. Which of the following preprocessing steps would be most effective in normalizing the text for this purpose?

1. Applying a regular expression that removes all non-alphanumeric characters and converts all uppercase letters to lowercase.
2. Implementing an edit distance algorithm to group similar words together and then choosing the most frequent form as the representative for the group.
3. Using a lemmatizer that reduces words to their base or dictionary form, ensuring that 'running', 'runs', and 'ran' are all normalized to 'run'.
4. Creating a stemmer that truncates words to remove affixes, so that 'computer', 'computing', and 'computed' are reduced to the stem 'comput'.
5. Segmenting the text into sentences and then tokenizing each sentence into words without further normalization.

## Learning Outcomes

The question is designed to achieve the following learning outcomes:

- Assess the student's understanding of text normalization techniques and their impact on information retrieval systems.
- Evaluate the student's ability to distinguish between different preprocessing steps and their appropriateness for specific applications.
- Encourage critical thinking about the trade-offs between different normalization strategies, such as lemmatization versus stemming.
- Test the student's knowledge of the theoretical concepts behind word normalization and their practical implementation in NLP pipelines.

This question contributes to the students' mastery of natural language processing concepts by requiring them to apply their knowledge of text preprocessing to a real-world scenario. It challenges them to think critically about the purpose of normalization and to select the most effective technique for the given task.

## Answer

The correct answer is:

3. Using a lemmatizer that reduces words to their base or dictionary form, ensuring that 'running', 'runs', and 'ran' are all normalized to 'run'.

Explanation:

- Choice 1 is incorrect because simply removing non-alphanumeric characters and case normalization does not address the morphological variations of words.
- Choice 2 is incorrect because edit distance is typically used for spelling correction or similarity measurement, not for normalizing morphological forms of words.
- Choice 3 is correct because lemmatization specifically aims to reduce words to their base or dictionary form, which is ideal for an information retrieval system that needs to recognize different morphological forms of a word as the same term.
- Choice 4 is incorrect because stemming might be too aggressive for an information retrieval system, as it can lead to over-stemming or under-stemming, which can affect retrieval accuracy. Lemmatization is generally more sophisticated and context-aware.
- Choice 5 is incorrect because sentence segmentation and tokenization are initial steps in text preprocessing, but they do not normalize the morphological variations of words, which is necessary for the described information retrieval system.
