This question assesses the understanding of fine-tuning techniques for BERT models in the context of a question-answering task, a common application of Natural Language Processing (NLP). Let's evaluate the options provided:

1. **Adding an additional pre-training step focusing solely on span-based masking to encourage more effective recognition of answer spans within the text.** This modification is relevant and promising for question-answering systems. BERT is originally pre-trained with masked language modeling (MLM), which involves predicting masked tokens without specifically focusing on recognizing answer spans in a text. Incorporating a span-based masking step could enhance the model's ability to identify and predict answer spans, making it a plausible improvement for a question-answering task.

2. **Increasing the number of layers in the Transformer encoder to enhance the model's ability to capture deeper contextual relationships, assuming computational resources are not a constraint.** While increasing the model's depth could theoretically improve its understanding of complex textual relationships, this approach does not directly address the specific requirements of a question-answering system. Moreover, BERT's architecture is already quite deep, and further depth could lead to diminishing returns and increased training difficulty without focused adjustments for the task.

3. **Implementing an attention mechanism that only focuses on the question part of the input, to reduce the computational load and increase processing speed.** This modification might improve processing speed but at the cost of ignoring the context provided by the passage. In question-answering tasks, understanding the context in which the question is placed is crucial. Thus, focusing attention solely on the question could detrimentally affect performance, making this option less desirable.

4. **Training the model exclusively on NSP tasks during fine-tuning to improve the model's understanding of sentence relationships within the context of questions and answers.** NSP (Next Sentence Prediction) is indeed part of BERT's original pre-training tasks. However, focusing exclusively on NSP during fine-tuning is not aligned with the objectives of question-answering systems, which require the model to identify specific spans of text as answers. NSP could help with understanding sentence relationships but is not directly beneficial for extracting answer spans.

5. **Integrating an external linguistic rules-based system for pre-processing questions and answers to ensure the model has more structured input data.** While pre-processing input data to make it more structured can be helpful in some NLP tasks, the power of models like BERT lies in their ability to understand and process natural language without heavily relying on rule-based systems. This approach might not significantly enhance BERT's performance for question-answering and could introduce complexity and rigidity that diminish the benefits of using a deep learning model.

The most appropriate modification is option **1**. It directly addresses a critical aspect of question-answering tasks, which is the identification and extraction of relevant answer spans from the context. By focusing on span-based masking during fine-tuning, the model can become more adept at pinpointing the exact spans that constitute correct answers, improving its overall performance on question-answering tasks.
