## Question
Given a scenario where a research team is designing a novel Transformer-based language model (LM) to generate realistic narratives, which aspect of the model's design would most effectively balance the trade-offs between computational efficiency and the model's ability to capture long-range dependencies in text? Consider the architecture and training strategies covered in your course.

1. Increasing the number of layers in the Transformer model while keeping the size of the model embeddings constant.
2. Utilizing a dynamic attention mechanism that adjusts the span of attention based on the sequence length, instead of the standard fixed-length attention.
3. Doubling the size of the model embeddings and the feed-forward networks within each Transformer block, without altering the number of layers or attention heads.
4. Incorporating an additional pre-training task that specifically targets the prediction of next sentence given a context, aiming to improve long-range coherence in generated narratives.
5. Implementing a novel, sparse attention mechanism that allows each token to attend to a subset of previous tokens determined by a fixed pattern, reducing the overall computational complexity.

## Solution
The correct answer is **5. Implementing a novel, sparse attention mechanism that allows each token to attend to a subset of previous tokens determined by a fixed pattern, reducing the overall computational complexity.**

### Reasoning
To arrive at the correct answer, let's analyze each option in the context of balancing computational efficiency with the capability to capture long-range dependencies:

1. **Increasing the number of layers**: While adding more layers can potentially enhance the model's ability to learn complex features and relationships, it significantly increases computational costs and may not directly address the specific challenge of capturing long-range dependencies more efficiently.

2. **Dynamic attention mechanism**: Adjusting the attention span dynamically can indeed help in focusing computational resources where needed; however, this approach doesn't inherently reduce computational complexity. It can be complex to implement and may not always lead to improvements in efficiency, especially if the dynamic adjustments are computationally intensive themselves.

3. **Doubling the size of embeddings and feed-forward networks**: This option would increase the model's capacity, potentially enabling it to learn richer representations. However, it would also substantially increase the computational load, both in terms of memory and processing power, without specifically enhancing the model's ability to handle long-range dependencies in a more computationally efficient manner.

4. **Additional pre-training task**: Introducing a new pre-training task focused on predicting the next sentence might improve the model's understanding of narrative coherence and structure, but it doesn't directly address the computational efficiency aspect or the model's capability to manage long-range dependencies more effectively.

5. **Sparse attention mechanism**: This approach directly targets the computational complexity issue by limiting the number of tokens each token attends to, thus reducing the computational cost of the attention mechanism. It also retains the model's ability to capture long-range dependencies by strategically selecting which tokens to attend to. This method offers a practical compromise between enhancing efficiency and maintaining, or even improving, the model's performance in terms of handling long-range dependencies.

## Correct Answer
5. Implementing a novel, sparse attention mechanism that allows each token to attend to a subset of previous tokens determined by a fixed pattern, reducing the overall computational complexity.

This choice presents a direct method to balance computational efficiency with the linguistic capability of capturing long-range dependencies, making it the most effective strategy among the given options.
