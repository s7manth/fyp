## Question
You are tasked with enhancing a Transformer-based language model to better handle context from longer documents. Your primary goal is to maintain the original structure's efficient parallelization while improving its ability to capture long-distance dependencies beyond what typical positional encodings allow. Which of the following modifications would best address this challenge?

1. Increase the dimension of the token embeddings to add more capacity for representing longer dependencies.
2. Introduce a recurrent layer before the Transformer blocks to capture sequential information over long texts.
3. Implement a hierarchical attention mechanism where the model first attends to local context within segments and then integrates these segments at a higher level.
4. Replace the transformer's self-attention mechanism with a convolutional layer to better capture local dependencies.
5. Add more layers to the Transformer model to increase its depth and thus its ability to capture complex patterns.

## Solution

The correct answer is 3. Implement a hierarchical attention mechanism where the model first attends to local context within segments and then integrates these segments at a higher level.

### Reasoning

1. **Increasing the dimension of the token embeddings**: While increasing the embedding size might give the model more capacity to represent information, it doesn't directly address the issue of capturing dependencies over long distances within the text. The embeddings represent individual tokens or words, not the relationships between distant parts of the text.

2. **Introducing a recurrent layer**: Adding recurrent layers (such as LSTM or GRU) before the Transformer blocks could, in theory, help capture longer dependencies due to their sequential processing nature. However, this approach would sacrifice the Transformer's inherent parallelization capabilities. Recurrent models process data sequentially, which is less efficient than the parallel processing of Transformers.

3. **Implementing a hierarchical attention mechanism**: This approach is specifically designed to tackle the challenge of capturing long-range dependencies in a more structured and scalable manner. By first focusing on local context and then integrating this information at a higher level, the model can efficiently process longer documents. This method maintains the parallelizability of the Transformer architecture while enhancing its ability to handle context over longer texts.

4. **Replacing the Transformer's self-attention with a convolutional layer**: While convolutional layers are effective at capturing local dependencies, they are not as adept at handling long-range dependencies, especially in comparison to self-attention mechanisms. This replacement would also diverge from leveraging the Transformer's strength in modeling complex relationships between tokens regardless of their position.

5. **Adding more layers to the Transformer model**: Increasing the depth of the Transformer can indeed help it capture more complex patterns and relationships. However, simply adding more layers does not specifically address the challenge of modeling long-distance dependencies within a document. It also increases the model's computational requirements and can lead to issues like vanishing gradients, making training more difficult.

Therefore, implementing a hierarchical attention mechanism (Option 3) directly addresses the challenge of capturing long-distance dependencies in a structured way that complements the original strengths of the Transformer model.

## Correct Answer

3. Implement a hierarchical attention mechanism where the model first attends to local context within segments and then integrates these segments at a higher level.
