 ## Problem Statement

Consider a large corpus of customer reviews for a popular e-commerce website. The goal is to build a model that can identify products with similar reviews based on their textual content. For this task, you will use a combination of vector semantics and lexical semantics approaches.

Given the following requirements:
1. Create term-document matrices using TF-IDF for two sets of words (A and B) extracted from the reviews.
2. Extract word embeddings using Word2vec for a subset of words in each set.
3. Measure the cosine similarity between the word vectors in Set A and Set B to find pairs of related words.
4. Use Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) to identify high-probability co-occurring word pairs within each set.
5. Visualize the embeddings for a selection of words from both sets using t-SNE or PCA.
6. Evaluate the performance of your model by computing the precision and recall for retrieving products with similar reviews.

Based on the above, which choice best describes how to apply vector semantics, lexical semantics, and various techniques (TF-IDF, Word2vec, Cosine Similarity, and PMI) to identify related words and evaluate the model's performance?

## Choices

1. Create term-document matrices using TF-IDF for Set A and B, then extract word embeddings using Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) for a subset of words in each set. Measure cosine similarity between the PMI vectors and visualize them using t-SNE.
2. Extract word embeddings using Word2vec for Set A and Cosine Similarity for Set B, then measure the TF-IDF between related pairs of words within each set. Visualize the embeddings using PCA and evaluate the model's performance based on precision and recall.
3. Create term-document matrices using TF-IDF for Set A and B, extract word embeddings using Word2vec for a subset of words in each set, measure cosine similarity between related pairs of words within each set, and use PMI to identify high-probability co-occurring word pairs. Visualize the embeddings using t-SNE and evaluate the model's performance based on precision and recall.
4. Extract word embeddings using Word2vec for Set A and Cosine Similarity for Set B, create term-document matrices using TF-IDF for each set, measure the TF-IDF between related pairs of words within each set, and use PMI to identify high-probability co-occurring word pairs. Visualize the embeddings using t-SNE and evaluate the model's performance based on precision and recall.
5. Create term-document matrices using TF-IDF for Set A and B, extract word embeddings using Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) for a subset of words in each set, measure cosine similarity between related pairs of words within each set, and use Word2vec to identify high-probability co-occurring word pairs. Visualize the embeddings using PCA and evaluate the model's performance based on precision and recall.

## Solution

The correct answer is: 3. Create term-document matrices using TF-IDF for Set A and B, extract word embeddings using Word2vec for a subset of words in each set, measure cosine similarity between related pairs of words within each set, and use PMI to identify high-probability co-occurring word pairs. Visualize the embeddings using t-SNE and evaluate the model's performance based on precision and recall.

This solution is correct because it combines multiple techniques: creating term-document matrices using TF-IDF, extracting word embeddings using Word2vec, measuring cosine similarity between related pairs of words, and using PMI to identify high-probability co-occurring word pairs. This comprehensive approach allows for a deep understanding of both vector semantics (TF-IDF, Cosine Similarity, and Word2vec) and lexical semantics (PMI). Additionally, visualizing the embeddings using t-SNE or PCA provides insights into the semantic properties of the vectors.

## Reasoning

The problem statement requires applying various techniques to identify related words and evaluate the model's performance. The choices provided include a mix of techniques from vector semantics (TF-IDF, Cosine Similarity, and Word2vec) and lexical semantics (PMI). It is essential to understand that each technique serves a different purpose in NLP tasks:

1. TF-IDF: Weighing terms in the document based on their importance in a collection of documents.
2. Cosine Similarity: Measuring similarity between two non-zero vectors by calculating the cosine of the angle between them.
3. Word2vec: A shallow neural network model that produces word embeddings that capture semantic meaning and relationships.
4. Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI): A statistical measure of association between two items in a dataset, often used to identify high-probability co-occurring pairs.

The correct choice applies all these techniques while staying true to the given requirements: create term-document matrices using TF-IDF for both sets, extract word embeddings using Word2vec, measure cosine similarity between related pairs of words, and use PMI to identify high-probability co-occurring word pairs. Visualizing the embeddings provides additional insights into the semantic properties of the vectors, allowing for a comprehensive understanding and evaluation of the model's performance.
