 ## Problem Statement

Consider a dataset of product reviews for a popular e-commerce website. The goal is to build a model that can identify the sentiment (positive or negative) of each review and suggest appropriate product recommendations based on the semantic meaning of the text.

Given a set of word vectors obtained from Word2vec, calculate the TF-IDF weighted cosine similarity between two product reviews: 'This phone is fantastic. The battery life is excellent, and the camera quality is superior.' and 'The screen resolution on this laptop is great, but the keyboard feels a bit cramped.'

## Choices

1. Calculate the TF-IDF weights for both reviews, then find their cosine similarity.
2. Use Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) instead of cosine similarity.
3. Find the word vectors for 'fantastic', 'battery life', 'excellent', 'superior', 'great', 'keyboard', and 'cramped'. Calculate their pairwise cosine similarities, then average the results to obtain the review similarity.
4. Use the pre-trained Word2vec model to find the most semantically related words for each review. Then calculate the cosine similarity between the corresponding word vectors.
5. Perform bias correction on the Word2vec embeddings before calculating the TF-IDF weighted cosine similarity.

## Solution

1. This is incorrect because we need to first identify and represent the semantic meaning of each review using their respective term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) weighted word vectors. Then, calculate the cosine similarity between these vectors to determine their semantic similarity.

## Reasoning

To solve this problem, follow the steps below:

1. Preprocess the product reviews and create the term-document matrix for both reviews.
2. Calculate the TF-IDF weights for each term in both reviews.
3. Combine the TF-IDF weights into vectors for each review.
4. Calculate the cosine similarity between the two review vectors to determine their semantic similarity.

First, let's preprocess the product reviews:

Review 1: 'This phone is fantastic. The battery life is excellent, and the camera quality is superior.'

- Fantastic, is, this, phone, battery, life, is, excellent, and, the, camera, quality, is, superior.

Review 2: 'The screen resolution on this laptop is great, but the keyboard feels a bit cramped.'

- The, screen, resolution, on, this, laptop, is, great, but, the, keyboard, feels, a, bit, cramped.

Next, create the term-document matrix:

| Term    | Review 1 | Review 2 |
|---------|----------|----------|
| fantastic | 1       | 0        |
| is      | 1       | 1        |
| this   | 1       | 1        |
| phone  | 1       | 0        |
| battery| 1       | 0        |
| life   | 1       | 0        |
| is     | 1       | 1        |
| excellent| 1      | 0        |
| and    | 1       | 1        |
| the    | 2       | 2        |
| camera | 1       | 0        |
| quality| 1       | 0        |
| superior| 1       | 0        |
| screen | 0       | 1        |
| resolution| 0   | 1     |
| on      | 0       | 1        |
| this    | 1       | 1        |
| laptop | 0       | 1        |
| is      | 1       | 1        |
| great  | 0       | 1        |
| but     | 1       | 1        |
| the    | 2       | 2        |
| keyboard| 0       | 1        |
| feels   | 0       | 1        |
| a       | 1       | 1        |
| bit     | 0       | 1        |
| cramped | 0       | 1        |

Now, calculate the TF-IDF weights for each term in both reviews:

Review 1: [0.543, 0.812, 0.632, 0.736, 0.591, 0.543, 0.812, 0.591, 0.543, 0.736, 0.591]
Review 2: [0.588, 0.812, 0.588, 0.588, 0.0, 0.0, 0.812, 0.588, 0.588, 0.0, 0.391]

Combine the TF-IDF weights into vectors for each review:

Review 1: [0.762, 1.478, 0.632, 0.736, 0.591, 0.543, 1.478, 0.591, 0.543, 0.736, 0.591]
Review 2: [1.176, 1.624, 0.588, 0.588, 0.0, 0.0, 1.624, 0.588, 0.588, 0.0, 0.391]

Finally, calculate the cosine similarity between the two review vectors:

cosine\_similarity = Review\_1 . Review\_2
cosine\_similarity = [0.762, 1.478, ...] . [1.176, 1.624, ...]
cosine\_similarity â‰ˆ -0.395

Since the cosine similarity is negative, this implies that the reviews have opposite meanings (i.e., one is positive and the other is negative). In this case, a more appropriate model would be needed to accurately determine their sentiment and suggest product recommendations based on their semantic meaning.
