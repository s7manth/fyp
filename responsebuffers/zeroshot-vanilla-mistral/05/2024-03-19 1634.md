 ## Problem Statement

Consider a corpus of news articles from different sources, discussing various political figures. Your goal is to build a model that can identify the political affiliation of each article based on its text. You have access to preprocessed data, including TF-IDF vector representations and Word2vec embeddings for each word in the corpus.

Given the following requirements, choose the best approach for building your model:

1. Use TF-IDF vectors only without any preprocessing or feature engineering.
2. Use Word2vec embeddings directly as input features to a classifier.
3. Combine both TF-IDF and Word2vec representations before feeding them into a classifier.
4. Extract semantic properties from the Word2vec embeddings and use cosine similarity to determine political affiliation.
5. Use Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) instead of TF-IDF for generating word vectors.

## Choices

1. Use TF-IDF vectors only without any preprocessing or feature engineering.
2. Use Word2vec embeddings directly as input features to a classifier.
3. Combine both TF-IDF and Word2vec representations before feeding them into a classifier.
4. Extract semantic properties from the Word2vec embeddings and use cosine similarity to determine political affiliation.
5. Use Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) instead of TF-IDF for generating word vectors.

## Solution

The correct answer is: 3. Combine both TF-IDF and Word2vec representations before feeding them into a classifier.

## Reasoning

This question requires a deep understanding of multiple topics, including TF-IDF, Word2vec, cosine similarity, and the applications of these vector models in NLP tasks. To arrive at the best approach for building the model, let's consider each choice:

1. Using only TF-IDF vectors might not capture semantic relationships between words since it is based on term frequency rather than word meaning.
2. Directly using Word2vec embeddings as input features to a classifier might result in poor performance due to the high dimensionality of the vectors and the limited amount of labeled data for fine-tuning the model.
3. Combining both TF-IDF and Word2vec representations can leverage the strengths of each representation: TF-IDF for capturing document-term relationships (i.e., term frequency), and Word2vec for understanding semantic meaning between words. By merging these two types of representations, we can create a more comprehensive model that considers both term presence and meaning.
4. Extracting semantic properties from the Word2vec embeddings and using cosine similarity to determine political affiliation would be an incorrect assumption since cosine similarity is only one way of measuring semantic similarity between vectors, but it might not capture all aspects of political affiliation in text.
5. Using Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) instead of TF-IDF for generating word vectors could potentially lead to better performance as PMI captures the context and co-occurrence of words, which can be beneficial when dealing with text data. However, PMI does not provide a vector representation of the words directly, so it would need to be combined with other methods (such as LSI or LDA) to create dense vectors for further analysis. In this case, it is more practical and computationally efficient to use TF-IDF for generating initial word vectors, and then fine-tune them using Word2vec.

Therefore, the best approach is to combine both TF-IDF and Word2vec representations before feeding them into a classifier.
