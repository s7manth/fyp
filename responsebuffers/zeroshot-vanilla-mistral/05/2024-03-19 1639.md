 ## Problem Statement

Consider a large corpus of customer reviews for a popular e-commerce website, where each review is labeled as positive or negative based on its content. The goal is to build a model that can accurately predict the sentiment label (positive or negative) of new, unseen reviews based on their textual content.

Given the following considerations, choose the best approach for creating an effective vector representation of these reviews:

1. You want to capture semantic meanings and relationships between words in the reviews while considering the frequency of occurrence of each word.
2. The vocabulary size is too large to work with in raw form, so you need a method to reduce it down to a manageable size.
3. You would like to incorporate pre-existing knowledge about word meanings and relationships to improve model performance.

## Choices

1. Use TF-IDF for feature extraction, then train a Naive Bayes classifier on the resulting features.
2. Apply Word2vec to obtain word embeddings and average them to get a review representation, then use these representations as input to a neural network model for sentiment analysis.
3. Implement Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) to capture semantic relationships between words and use it as a similarity measure in a cosine similarity-based approach.
4. Use the pre-trained GloVe word embeddings to represent each review as a fixed-length vector and apply cosine similarity for sentiment prediction.
5. Perform feature extraction using Term Frequency (TF) only, then use cosine similarity for sentiment analysis with a bag-of-words model.

## Solution

The best approach is: **2. Apply Word2vec to obtain word embeddings and average them to get a review representation, then use these representations as input to a neural network model for sentiment analysis.**

This solution addresses all the given requirements:

1. Word2vec creates dense vector representations of words that capture semantic meanings and relationships between them. By averaging the word vectors in each review, we obtain a fixed-length representation of the entire text that considers the context of its constituent words.

2. TF-IDF is a method for reducing feature dimensionality by weighing terms based on their frequency in a document and importance within a corpus. However, it does not capture semantic relationships between words (except through term co-occurrence). In contrast, Word2vec is designed to learn rich word representations that preserve semantic relationships.

3. PMI captures semantic relationships between pairs of words but is limited in its ability to handle larger contexts such as entire sentences or documents. By using Word2vec to capture these relationships within a review and then averaging the resulting word vectors, we effectively incorporate this knowledge into our model.

4. GloVe word embeddings are pre-trained on large corpora and can be used off-the-shelf for various NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis. However, averaging word vectors in a review as in option 2 allows us to capture the context of the constituent words within each review, while GloVe embeddings may not fully capture this information.

5. TF only does not take into account semantic relationships between words, making it less effective for capturing the meaning and sentiment of reviews.

## Reasoning

The challenge in this problem lies in creating an effective representation of textual data to be used as input to a machine learning model for sentiment analysis. The given requirements suggest that we should capture semantic meanings and relationships between words while also considering their frequency within the corpus.

TF-IDF is a popular feature extraction technique that does not directly create dense word representations but rather generates sparse vectors based on term frequencies in documents and their importance within a corpus. While this method reduces the dimensionality of our feature space, it does not capture semantic relationships between words (beyond co-occurrence).

Word2vec, on the other hand, creates dense vector representations of words that learn semantic meanings and relationships by analyzing local contexts in large corpora. By averaging these word vectors to obtain a fixed-length representation for each review, we preserve the contextual information of the constituent words while taking advantage of pre-existing knowledge about word meanings and relationships.

Additionally, neural network models are known to be effective at learning complex patterns and relationships within data, making them a suitable choice for sentiment analysis based on these dense vector representations.
