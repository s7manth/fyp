## Problem Statement

Consider a corpus of news articles related to two political candidates, A and B. Each article is represented as a bag-of-words (BoW) vector in a 1000-dimensional space using TF-IDF weighting with the following top terms: [democrat, republican, policy, economy, tax, health, experience, leadership].

Given a new article about candidate A that contains the words "experienced," "economy," and "policy," and an article about candidate B containing the words "inexperienced," "tax," and "health," which vector represents the article with the closest semantic meaning to the vector for candidate A?

## Choices

1. The BoW vector of the article about candidate B that contains the words "tax" and "health."
2. The average of the BoW vectors for both articles.
3. The TF-IDF vector for the new article about candidate A.
4. The Word2vec embedding of the word "experienced."
5. The most semantically similar Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) vector to the candidate A's BoW vector.

## Solution

The correct answer is 5. The most semantically similar Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) vector to the candidate A's BoW vector is the one that best represents the meaning of the words "experienced," "economy," and "policy" in relation to candidate A. PMI captures the co-occurrence probability between words in a corpus, which can provide insight into their semantic relationships. In this case, finding the most similar PMI vector will help us identify an embedding that shares the same context with the words "experienced," "economy," and "policy" when describing candidate A.

## Reasoning

To understand why choice 5 is the correct answer, let's break down each option:

1. The BoW vector of the article about candidate B that contains the words "tax" and "health" is unlikely to be semantically close to the vector for candidate A since the articles have distinct topics and the word "experienced" is not present in this choice.
2. The average of the BoW vectors for both articles would result in a vector that is an equal blend of the two, which may not represent the meaning of either article accurately.
3. The TF-IDF vector for the new article about candidate A may not be semantically close to the embedding for candidate A because it represents the specific article and not the overall meaning of the candidate across all articles.
4. The Word2vec embedding of the word "experienced" does not represent the entire meaning of the articles about candidate A, as it only captures the context of the word itself rather than the broader meaning of the candidate.
5. The most semantically similar PMI vector to the candidate A's BoW vector represents the words that are most strongly related to the candidate based on their co-occurrence in the corpus. This can provide insight into the underlying meaning and context of the articles about candidate A, making it a more accurate representation of the semantic similarity between the two articles.
