## Problem Statement

You are working on a text classification project to identify the sentiment of product reviews. For this task, you decide to use a Naive Bayes classifier. You have collected a dataset of 10,000 product reviews labeled as positive or negative. The dataset is split into training and test sets with a ratio of 80:20.

To optimize your model for sentiment analysis, you explore various techniques discussed in the course, including smoothing and stop words removal. However, you still observe some misclassifications. To further improve your classifier's performance, you decide to employ a new feature engineering technique.

Given the following choices, which feature engineering method would you apply to improve the Naive Bayes sentiment analysis model?

1. Stemming
2. Named Entity Recognition (NER)
3. Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging
4. Sentiment lexicon
5. Dependency Parsing
 
## Choices

1. Stemming: Reducing inflected words to their base form, e.g., 'running' -> 'run'.
2. Named Entity Recognition (NER): Identifying and extracting named entities from text, e.g., 'Apple Inc.'.
3. Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging: Assigning each word a specific part of speech, e.g., 'the' -> determiner.
4. Sentiment lexicon: A collection of words with pre-assigned sentiment scores, e.g., 'happy' has a positive score.
5. Dependency Parsing: Determining the relationships between words in a sentence, e.g., subject-verb relationships.

## Solution

To improve the Naive Bayes sentiment analysis model, you would apply **Sentiment lexicon**.

By incorporating a sentiment lexicon, you can leverage a pre-existing collection of words with pre-assigned sentiment scores. This allows your classifier to recognize the emotional context in text more accurately and effectively, as it can associate specific sentiments with individual words.

## Reasoning

The problem requires us to identify the feature engineering technique that would best improve the Naive Bayes sentiment analysis model's performance. We are given several choices, including Stemming, Named Entity Recognition (NER), Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging, Sentiment lexicon, and Dependency Parsing.

Stemming is a technique that reduces inflected words to their base form, which can help simplify the input text and reduce dimensionality. However, it does not provide any explicit sentiment information.

Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging are both important techniques for text analysis but do not directly address sentiment classification. NER identifies named entities within text, such as company names or locations, while POS tagging assigns each word a specific part of speech.

Dependency Parsing determines the relationships between words in a sentence, which can be useful in understanding the context and meaning behind sentences but does not provide explicit sentiment information.

In contrast, a **sentiment lexicon** is a collection of words with pre-assigned sentiment scores. By incorporating this into our model, we can leverage emotional context within text more effectively, allowing for better sentiment classification. Therefore, the correct answer is (4) Sentiment lexicon.
