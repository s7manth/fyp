## Problem Statement

Consider a social media platform where users post textual comments accompanying their posts. The platform's management is concerned about the impact of user-generated content on its community and wants to develop a system for automatically categorizing these comments into three sentiment categories: positive, negative, or neutral. To build this system, you have been given access to a dataset containing 10,000 labeled comments.

Your task is to design and implement a Naive Bayes classifier using the provided data. However, there are several challenges that need to be addressed:

1. The training dataset is imbalanced with significantly more neutral comments than positive or negative ones.
2. To optimize the classifier's performance for sentiment analysis, you can apply preprocessing techniques like stop words removal and stemming.
3. The Naive Bayes model assumes independence between features, which may not hold true in text classification tasks. Discuss how you would address this assumption.
4. After implementing the classifier, you need to evaluate its performance using appropriate metrics. Given the imbalanced dataset, which metric should you use and why?
5. To ensure the classifier does not harm users or misclassify sensitive posts, discuss potential strategies for avoiding harms in classification.

## Choices

1. Use Precision as the evaluation metric since it measures the number of correctly identified positive comments against all identified positives.
2. Preprocess the data by removing stop words and applying stemming techniques to handle the independence assumption in text classification tasks.
3. Ignore the imbalance issue by randomly undersampling neutral comments or oversampling positive/negative ones before training the classifier.
4. Use Recall as the evaluation metric since it measures the number of correctly identified positive comments against all actual positives in the dataset.
5. Implement a threshold mechanism to exclude sensitive keywords and phrases from the classifier's input, ensuring it does not harm users or misclassify their posts.

## Solution

1. While Precision is an essential metric for text classification tasks, using it alone may not be appropriate given the imbalanced dataset. Recall (also known as Sensitivity) would be a more suitable choice since it measures the proportion of true positives among all actual positives in the data. In this case, we want to ensure that our classifier can correctly identify a large percentage of positive comments even if the overall number is small.

2. Preprocessing techniques like stop words removal and stemming are essential for handling text data in natural language processing tasks, especially when dealing with text classification problems. By removing common words (stop words) and reducing inflected forms to their base form (stemming), we can improve the performance of our Naive Bayes classifier by reducing noise and focusing on meaningful features.

3. To address the assumption of feature independence in text classification tasks, we could consider applying techniques such as Bigram Models or N-gram models. These methods capture dependencies between adjacent words (bi-grams) or phrases (N-grams), allowing for more accurate modeling of the data and better handling of contextual relationships between features.

4. To optimize the classifier's performance for sentiment analysis, we should combine both Precision and Recall metrics by using their harmonic mean, which is known as F1-score. By calculating the weighted average of Precision and Recall with a predefined weight, we can ensure that our classifier balances between correctly identifying positive comments (Precision) and not missing any (Recall).

5. To avoid harms in classification, we could implement several strategies like using a pre-approved list of sensitive keywords/phrases or applying sentiment analysis only to specific user groups with explicit consent. Additionally, we can include human oversight by having moderators review flagged posts before taking any action based on the classifier's output. Another approach would be to use external knowledge sources like dictionaries and ontologies to identify potentially harmful content.

## Reasoning

The problem statement requires a deep understanding of Naive Bayes Classifiers, their application in text classification tasks, optimizing classifier performance for sentiment analysis, and evaluating the performance using appropriate metrics such as Precision, Recall, and F1-score. The question challenges students to apply these concepts in a complex scenario involving an imbalanced dataset and potential harms in classification. By providing choices that require a synthesis of ideas from various sources, we encourage critical analysis and problem-solving skills among advanced undergraduate natural language processing students.
