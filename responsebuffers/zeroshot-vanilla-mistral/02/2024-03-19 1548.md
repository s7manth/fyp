 ## Problem Statement

Given a large corpus of text data, you are tasked with building an N-gram language model to predict the probability distribution over the next word in a sentence. You have implemented N-gram models up to order 3 (trigrams), and have trained them on your training dataset. To evaluate the quality of your model, you need to calculate the perplexity on a separate test set.

However, your model's performance is unsatisfactory, with high perplexity values. You suspect that there are several issues impacting the generalization ability of your model. Identify the potential causes and propose solutions to mitigate their effects.

## Choices

1. The training set is biased towards certain words, leading to over-representation in the language model. This can be solved by: a) Increasing the size of the training dataset b) Using Kneser-Ney smoothing c) Implementing Zeros and smoothing d) Applying Huge Language Models and Stupid Backoff
2. The absence of certain infrequent words in the training set leads to zero probability during prediction, which impacts the model's generalization ability. This can be addressed by: a) Removing those words from the test dataset b) Using N-grams up to order 5 c) Applying Kneser-Ney smoothing d) Implementing Zeros and smoothing
3. The language model lacks diversity in handling rare sequences of words, leading to high perplexity values. This can be improved by: a) Increasing the size of the training dataset b) Using Huge Language Models and Stupid Backoff c) Applying Kneser-Ney smoothing d) Sampling sentences from the language model
4. The test set includes sentences that are significantly different from those in the training data, leading to a high perplexity. This can be addressed by: a) Collecting a more diverse training dataset b) Increasing the size of the test dataset c) Applying Huge Language Models and Stupid Backoff d) Using Kneser-Ney smoothing
5. The language model's performance is dependent on the choice of N, with lower values providing better predictions for smaller datasets but poorer generalization for larger ones. This can be addressed by: a) Choosing a larger value of N b) Implementing Zeros and smoothing c) Using Huge Language Models and Stupid Backoff d) Applying Kneser-Ney smoothing

## Solution

The first choice, "The training set is biased towards certain words, leading to over-representation in the language model," is partially correct. While it's true that a biased training set can lead to over-representation of some words in the language model, the given solutions are not optimal for this problem. A larger training dataset would help capture more variability in the language, but it does not directly address bias or over-representation.

The correct solution is to apply smoothing techniques such as Kneser-Ney smoothing. This technique addresses the zero probability issue by redistributing probabilities from more frequent words to less frequent ones. It improves the generalization ability of the model by providing a more uniform distribution over all possible next words.

The second choice, "The absence of certain infrequent words in the training set leads to zero probability during prediction," is also correct. However, removing those words from the test dataset or using higher-order N-grams would not effectively solve this problem. Instead, implementing Zeros and smoothing techniques, such as Kneser-Ney smoothing, helps mitigate the issue by providing non-zero probabilities for these infrequent words.

The third choice, "The language model lacks diversity in handling rare sequences of words," is partially correct. Increasing the size of the training dataset or using Huge Language Models and Stupid Backoff might help improve the model's ability to handle more diverse sequences. However, these techniques alone are not sufficient. Kneser-Ney smoothing would further help address this issue by providing more uniform distributions over rare sequences of words.

The fourth choice, "The test set includes sentences that are significantly different from those in the training data," is a potential cause of high perplexity values. However, collecting a more diverse training dataset or increasing the size of the test dataset would not directly address this issue. Instead, applying techniques such as Huge Language Models and Stupid Backoff or using Kneser-Ney smoothing could help improve the model's ability to handle such differences by capturing more variability in the language data.

The fifth choice, "The language model's performance is dependent on the choice of N," is partially correct. Choosing a larger value of N might provide better predictions for smaller datasets but poorer generalization for larger ones. However, implementing Zeros and smoothing techniques or using Huge Language Models and Stupid Backoff would not directly address this issue. Instead, these techniques can help improve the model's performance by addressing some of the underlying causes that make the choice of N important in the first place, such as zero probabilities or handling rare sequences of words.

## Reasoning

To evaluate the quality of an N-gram language model, it is essential to calculate its perplexity on a separate test set. Perplexity measures how well the model predicts the next word in a sentence given the preceding context. High perplexity values indicate poor performance. Several factors can impact the generalization ability and overall performance of the N-gram language model:

1. Biased training data
2. Absence or underrepresentation of infrequent words in the training set
3. Limited diversity in handling rare sequences of words
4. Differences between the test set and the training data
5. The choice of N, which can impact both the model's ability to capture context and its generalization performance.

To address these issues, various techniques have been proposed: smoothing, including Zeros and Kneser-Ney smoothing; handling large language models with Huge Language Models and Stupid Backoff; and applying N-grams up to higher orders. Each technique tackles different aspects of the problem to improve the overall performance of the model. The solutions provided in the question are not exhaustive, but they cover several common techniques used for addressing these issues.
