 ## Problem Statement

You are working on a natural language processing project for a social media platform that aims to suggest relevant hashtags for users based on their previous posts. To accomplish this, you plan to use an N-gram language model. However, you encounter several challenges in building and evaluating the model.

1. Which of the following methods should you use to build an N-gram language model with order 3 from a text corpus:
   a) Use unigrams as features and train a Markov model with trigram transitions?
   b) Train a model on a sliding window of size 3 and treat each window as an individual feature?
   c) Build a trigram model using the N-gram toolkit with a smoothing parameter of 0.5?
   d) Use n-grams as features and train a Hidden Markov Model (HMM)?

2. You have prepared two datasets: one for training the language model (training set), and another for testing its performance (test set). How should you evaluate the perplexity of your language model using these datasets?

3. The perplexity score is closely related to which information theoretic concept?
   a) Precision
   b) Recall
   c) F1 score
   d) Entropy

4. Your N-gram language model generates some incorrect suggestions for users' hashtags due to out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words. To improve the model's performance, you decide to apply which smoothing technique?
   a) Generalization and zeros
   b) Kneser-Ney smoothing
   c) Hapax legomena
   d) Stupid backoff

## Choices
1. a, b, c, d
2. By calculating the perplexity on the test set using the formula: $P(X) = 2^{\sum_{i=1}^{|X|} -\log P(x_i | x_{i-N+1:i-1})}$, where $X$ is a sequence of words, and $x_i$ represents the $i$-th word in the sequence.
3. d) Entropy
4. b) Kneser-Ney smooting

## Solution
1. The correct answer is b): Build a trigram model using the N-gram toolkit with a smoothing parameter of 0.5. This choice incorporates all three topics: N-grams (order 3), evaluating language models (using training and test sets), and smoothing (generalization and zeros, Kneser-Ney).

To build an N-gram model with order 3, the best approach is to use trigrams as features since we want to consider sequences of three consecutive words. However, treating each window of size 3 as an individual feature would result in too many features for a practical implementation (for large vocabularies and long sentences). Therefore, using the N-gram toolkit with a smoothing parameter is the preferred choice.

a) Using unigrams as features and training a Markov model with trigram transitions is incorrect because Markov models assume independence between features/states. In our case, we want to consider sequences of three consecutive words (trigrams), which violates this assumption.

c) Building a trigram model using the N-gram toolkit without any smoothing parameter is also not an ideal choice because it would only generate probabilities based on observed data, leading to zeros for unseen sequences and poor generalization performance.

d) Using n-grams as features and training a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is an incorrect choice as HMMs are designed for modeling sequences with hidden states, which is not our primary goal in this case.

2. The correct answer is to calculate the perplexity on the test set using the formula: $P(X) = 2^{\sum_{i=1}^{|X|} -\log P(x_i | x_{i-N+1:i-1})}$, where $X$ is a sequence of words, and $x_i$ represents the $i$-th word in the sequence. Perplexity measures how well our language model can predict a given corpus. In this context, we calculate perplexity on the test set to evaluate the model's performance after training it on the training dataset.

3. The correct answer is d: Entropy. Perplexity is related to entropy since they both measure information content in different ways. Perplexity is defined as $2^{H}$, where $H$ is the entropy of the distribution, and it measures how well a probabilistic model predicts a given dataset.

4. The correct answer is b: Kneser-Ney smoothing. This smoothing technique improves the language model's performance by adding pseudo counts to words that occur infrequently or are out-of-vocabulary (OOV). This approach helps in handling generalization and zeros, making the model perform better on new data.

## Reasoning
The question requires a deep understanding of various NLP concepts such as N-gram language models, evaluating language models using training and test sets, and different smoothing techniques like generalization and zeros, Kneser-Ney smoothing, etc. The choices are designed to challenge students to think critically and apply their knowledge to a complex scenario rather than relying on rote memorization or simple recall.

In the first question, we are asked to choose the correct method for building an N-gram language model with order 3 from a text corpus. Here, we need to understand that using trigrams as features is the best choice since we want to consider sequences of three consecutive words. However, treating each window of size 3 as an individual feature would lead to too many features and is not a practical implementation. Using the N-gram toolkit with a smoothing parameter allows us to handle unseen sequences and improve model performance by generalizing from observed data.

The second question asks us to evaluate the perplexity of our language model using the training and test datasets. We need to understand that perplexity measures how well our language model can predict a given corpus, which makes it an essential metric for evaluating the performance of an NLP model. In this context, we calculate perplexity on the test set to evaluate the model's generalization ability after training it on the training dataset.

The third question tests our knowledge by asking us to identify the information theoretic concept related to perplexity. We need to recall that perplexity is closely related to entropy as they both measure information content in different ways. Perplexity measures how well a probabilistic model can predict a given dataset, while entropy quantifies the amount of uncertainty or randomness in a system.

Finally, we are asked to apply smoothing techniques to improve the performance of our language model when handling OOV words. We need to understand that both generalization and zeros and Kneser-Ney smoothing are effective approaches for handling this problem. However, since the question specifies only one technique, we must choose the correct one - Kneser-Ney smoothing is a more advanced and effective approach in this context.
