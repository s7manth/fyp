 ## Problem Statement

Consider a bidirectional transformer encoder fine-tuned on a medical text corpus for the diagnosis of rare diseases. The model is able to generate contextually relevant embeddings, but its performance can be improved by using masked language models and fine-tuning with span-based masking.

Given this scenario, choose the best approach for enhancing the model's ability to learn effective contextual representations and improve its diagnosis accuracy:

1. Train a new bidirectional transformer encoder from scratch on the medical text corpus.
2. Fine-tune the pre-trained transformer encoder with masked language models.
3. Implement a unidirectional transformer decoder for fine-tuning and training.
4. Use contextual embeddings directly from the medical text corpus without any further processing.
5. Apply span-based masking during fine-tuning to encourage the model to learn more robust contextual representations.

## Choices

1. Train a new bidirectional transformer encoder from scratch on the medical text corpus.
2. Fine-tune the pre-trained transformer encoder with masked language models.
3. Implement a unidirectional transformer decoder for fine-tuning and training.
4. Use contextual embeddings directly from the medical text corpus without any further processing.
5. Apply span-based masking during fine-tuning to encourage the model to learn more robust contextual representations.

## Solution

The correct answer is: 5. Apply span-based masking during fine-tuning to encourage the model to learn more robust contextual representations.

## Reasoning

Fine-tuning pre-trained transformer models, such as BERT and RoBERTa, has proven to be an effective approach for various NLP tasks due to their ability to capture rich contextual information. However, in the case of medical diagnosis, the contextual understanding needs to be more nuanced since medical texts often contain complex and domain-specific terminology.

Masked language models (e.g., Masked Autoencoder, BERT masked language modeling) can help enhance the model's ability to learn effective contextual representations by filling in missing words based on the surrounding context. These models have achieved state-of-the-art results in various NLP tasks, including text classification and question answering, by leveraging their masked language modeling capability.

However, the standard masked language modeling approach, which masks 15% of tokens uniformly at random, may not be ideal for medical diagnosis since medical texts have a higher degree of context-dependent relationships between words compared to general text. To address this challenge, span-based masking was proposed as an advanced masking technique. Span-based masking involves masking contiguous segments (spans) of varying lengths, which encourages the model to learn more robust contextual representations by considering the interactions within and across spans.

Therefore, applying span-based masking during fine-tuning would be an effective approach for enhancing the transformer encoder's ability to learn effective contextual representations in medical diagnosis scenarios, as it can help the model capture complex relationships between medical terms and improve its diagnostic accuracy.
