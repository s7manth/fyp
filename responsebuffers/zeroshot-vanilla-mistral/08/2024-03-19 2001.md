 ## Problem Statement

Suppose you are working on a natural language understanding task for a healthcare domain, where the goal is to extract information about medical conditions and their treatments from unstructured text data. You have access to two pretrained models: Bidirectional Transformer Encoder (Bidirectional BERT) and a Masked Language Model (MLM). Both models have been fine-tuned on large corpora of text data but have not been specifically trained on medical texts.

To improve the performance of these models on your task, you decide to take the following steps:

1. Fine-tune each model using a labeled dataset of medical texts.
2. Apply masked language modeling techniques during fine-tuning to help the models learn more effectively from the data.
3. Utilize contextual embeddings for representing words and phrases in the text.
4. Experiment with span-based masking as an advanced technique for improving model performance.

Given this scenario, choose the best approach for each step based on the following choices:

## Choices

1. For fine-tuning Bidirectional BERT, you should use:
    a) A random initialization of the weights
    b) A pretrained BERT model without any fine-tuning
    c) A pretrained Bidirectional BERT model for bidirectional encoding
    d) A randomly initialized masked language model
    e) A pretrained Masked Language Model (MLM) for mask prediction
2. To apply masked language modeling during the fine-tuning of each model, you should:
    a) Remove all masked tokens from the labeled dataset
    b) Use only masked tokens as targets in the loss computation
    c) Add masked tokens to the input sequences at random locations
    d) Replace all occurrences of words with randomly chosen synonyms
    e) Freeze all layers except the final layer during training
3. To utilize contextual embeddings during the fine-tuning process, you should:
    a) Use bag-of-words representations for each word in the text
    b) Represent each word as its one-hot encoding
    c) Generate dense vectors (embeddings) based on their context in the text
    d) Apply Positional Encoding to each token's embedding
    e) Replace all occurrences of words with their averaged embeddings across a window
4. To experiment with span-based masking as an advanced technique, you should:
    a) Use only single tokens as masked targets during fine-tuning
    b) Mask entire phrases instead of individual tokens
    c) Remove all masked tokens from the input sequences during training
    d) Replace masked tokens with their most frequent contextual neighbors
    e) Use pretrained span-based models for answering complex questions on the text.

## Solution

1. For fine-tuning Bidirectional BERT, you should use:
   c) A pretrained Bidirectional BERT model for bidirectional encoding
2. To apply masked language modeling during the fine-tuning of each model, you should:
   c) Add masked tokens to the input sequences at random locations
3. To utilize contextual embeddings during the fine-tuning process, you should:
   c) Generate dense vectors (embeddings) based on their context in the text

## Reasoning

1. The correct answer for fine-tuning Bidirectional BERT is C, as we want to use a pretrained model specifically designed for bidirectional encoding to take advantage of its ability to process the context from both sides of a word.
2. The correct answer for applying masked language modeling during fine-tuning is C, as adding masked tokens to input sequences helps the models learn more effectively by forcing them to predict the masked tokens based on their context.
3. The correct answer for utilizing contextual embeddings during fine-tuning is C, as generating dense vectors based on their context in the text allows the model to consider the relationships between words and their meanings within a given sentence or document.
