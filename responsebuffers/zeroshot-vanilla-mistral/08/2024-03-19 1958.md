## Problem Statement

Consider a bidirectional transformer encoder fine-tuned on a dataset of customer support tickets for a large e-commerce platform. The model has been trained to identify and extract relevant information from customer queries, such as product names or issue descriptions, in order to provide accurate responses.

Now, given a new customer query about an "issue with the delivery of a specific product," the model is asked to identify both the product name and the issue type (delivery or product-related) based on the context provided in the query. The model can only see the customer query as input.

Based on your understanding of fine-tuning language models, bidirectional transformer encoders, training bidirectional encoders, contextual embeddings, and advanced masking techniques like span-based masking, identify the best approach for this task and choose the corresponding option.

## Choices

1. Fine-Tune a pre-trained masked language model (Masked Language Model - MLM) on the customer support dataset using span-based masking to predict both the product name and issue type in separate masks.
2. Train a new bidirectional transformer encoder from scratch on the customer support dataset with contextual embeddings for product names and issue types.
3. Fine-Tune a pre-trained bidirectional transformer encoder on the customer support dataset without masking or using any advanced techniques for multi-label classification tasks.
4. Use a rule-based system to extract the product name and issue type based on specific keywords in the query, then use a separate model for each label to perform binary classification.
5. Apply transfer learning by fine-tuning a pre-trained bidirectional transformer encoder on a large general language dataset, then perform semantic role labeling on the customer query output to extract product names and issue types.

## Solution

1. The best approach for this task is to fine-tune a pre-trained masked language model (Masked Language Model - MLM) on the customer support dataset using span-based masking to predict both the product name and issue type in separate masks.

## Reasoning

This problem requires identifying and extracting two distinct pieces of information from a given query: the product name and the issue type. It's important to note that these are not independent labels, as the issue type can depend on the product name, making this a multi-label classification task.

Fine-tuning a pre-trained masked language model (Masked Language Model - MLM) on the customer support dataset using span-based masking is an effective approach for handling such tasks. Masked Language Models are trained to predict masked words from their context, making them well-suited for extractive text summarization and entity recognition tasks like this one. By using span-based masks, we can train the model to identify and learn the representations of product names and issue types while preserving the relationships between these labels in the query context.

While other options might be valid approaches, they have limitations compared to fine-tuning a masked language model with span-based masks:

1. Training a new bidirectional transformer encoder from scratch on the customer support dataset would require a significant amount of labeled data and computational resources. It may not be necessary if pre-trained models can already capture the required representations for this task.
2. Fine-Tuning a pre-trained bidirectional transformer encoder without masking or advanced techniques might struggle with extracting multiple labels from a single query, as it's designed to perform sequence-to-sequence tasks like machine translation.
3. Rule-based systems have limited applicability in complex scenarios where the query context varies, and they lack the ability to generalize and learn from new data.
4. Transfer learning might not be the best choice here because the pre-trained model may not have learned representations of product names or issue types specifically; it would require additional fine-tuning on the customer support dataset.
