 ## Problem Statement

Consider a large language model built using transformers, which is trained on a vast corpus of text data. The model has been fine-tuned on a specific dataset to perform a certain natural language processing task. After deployment, the model starts generating incorrect and biased responses that were not observed during training.

Given the context above, identify the most likely cause of the issue and suggest a possible solution or mitigation strategy.

## Choices

1. The transformer architecture itself is flawed and cannot handle complex tasks effectively.
2. The model was under-trained and requires more data to achieve satisfactory performance.
3. There were unintended biases present in the training dataset that led to incorrect responses.
4. The fine-tuning procedure did not adequately adapt the pre-trained model for the specific task.
5. The large language model is inherently incapable of generating unbiased and accurate responses due to its size and complexity.

## Solution

The most likely cause of the issue is (3) there were unintended biases present in the training dataset that led to incorrect responses.

## Reasoning

This question requires an understanding of several topics, including transformers, large language models, and potential harms from language models. It's essential to consider how each choice aligns with these concepts.

Choice 1 is incorrect because the transformer architecture has proven to be highly effective in handling complex natural language processing tasks.

Choice 2 is also incorrect since the model was fine-tuned on a specific dataset, which indicates it had sufficient data for the task at hand.

Choice 5 is an oversimplification of the issue as large language models can generate unbiased and accurate responses if appropriately trained and fine-tuned.

However, choice 3 aligns with the given context. The issue arises from biases in the training data that were not accounted for during the fine-tuning procedure. These biases can lead to incorrect or discriminatory responses when generating new text. To mitigate this issue, it's crucial to collect diverse and representative training data and apply techniques such as data augmentation and adversarial examples to minimize unintended biases in the model. Additionally, researchers and practitioners should be vigilant about monitoring and addressing any observed biases or incorrect responses from the model during deployment.
