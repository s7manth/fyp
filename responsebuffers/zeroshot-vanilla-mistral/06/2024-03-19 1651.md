 ## Problem Statement

Consider a feed-forward neural network with one hidden layer, designed to classify whether a given sentence is positive or negative based on its text. The network has 10 input nodes (for each word in a 10-word maximum context window), 5 hidden nodes, and 2 output nodes. The network uses rectified linear units (ReLUs) as activation functions for all nodes except the output nodes, which use softmax functions.

The network is trained on a dataset of sentences labeled with their corresponding sentiment. However, during evaluation, it consistently misclassifies sentences containing the XOR logic operation. The developers suspect that this issue stems from the neural network's inability to capture logical relations between words and instead focuses only on individual word representations.

To address this problem, they propose the following solutions:

A) Increase the number of hidden nodes in the first hidden layer.
B) Use a different type of neural network architecture (e.g., Convolutional Neural Network or Recurrent Neural Network).
C) Add additional input features to the network, such as Part-of-Speech tags and word embeddings.
D) Train the network on a larger and more diverse dataset.
E) Apply a logical processing layer before the hidden layers.

## Choices

1. Increase the number of hidden nodes in the first hidden layer.
2. Use a different type of neural network architecture (e.g., Convolutional Neural Network or Recurrent Neural Network).
3. Add additional input features to the network, such as Part-of-Speech tags and word embeddings.
4. Train the network on a larger and more diverse dataset.
5. Apply a logical processing layer before the hidden layers.

## Solution

E) Apply a logical processing layer before the hidden layers.

## Reasoning

The XOR logic operation requires understanding the relationships between specific input features, rather than relying on individual word representations. Applying a logical processing layer before the hidden layers will enable the neural network to capture these logical relations explicitly and improve its performance on such complex cases.

Incorporating logical processing layers in natural language processing (NLP) tasks is a common approach when dealing with complex reasoning problems that require understanding logical relationships between words and concepts. Logical processing layers can be implemented using techniques like tree-structured parsing, dependency parsing, or other logical relation extraction methods.

By adding this layer to the existing neural network architecture, we allow the model to better capture the required logical relationships in the input data, enabling it to correctly classify sentences containing the XOR logic operation and potentially improve its overall performance on more complex NLP tasks.
