 ## Problem Statement

Given a corpus of text data from two distinct domains (Domain A and Domain B), you are tasked with building a feed-forward neural network that can accurately classify new texts as belonging to either Domain A or Domain B. The neural network should be trained on a labeled dataset using backpropagation and cross-entropy loss. However, the XOR problem arises when combining the features extracted from each domain due to their inherent differences in semantics and syntactical structures.

Design the neural network architecture, train it using the given dataset, and explain how you would modify it to handle the XOR problem between the two domains.

## Choices
1. Use a single feed-forward neural network with one hidden layer for both Domain A and Domain B.
2. Utilize two separate feed-forward neural networks, each specialized for its respective domain.
3. Implement a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract features from both domains.
4. Use a recurrent neural network (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cells to model the sequential dependencies in the data.
5. Combine a feed-forward network and a recurrent network for a hybrid approach.

## Solution

The correct answer is Choice 2: Utilize two separate feed-forward neural networks, each specialized for its respective domain.

Reasoning:
The XOR problem between the two domains arises due to their distinct semantics and syntactical structures. The features extracted from each domain will not be directly comparable or combinable in a single neural network architecture like Choice 1 (a single feed-forward neural network with one hidden layer for both Domain A and Domain B).

Instead, utilizing two separate feed-forward neural networks is an effective approach to handle the XOR problem. This allows each neural network to learn the unique characteristics of its corresponding domain without being influenced by the other. Each model can be designed according to the specific requirements of its respective domain's data, improving the overall classification performance.

Training these separate models follows standard feed-forward neural network training procedures, where we use backpropagation and cross-entropy loss to minimize the error between the predicted and actual labels. After training both models independently, you can combine their predictions using techniques like stacking or voting to make a final classification decision based on the inputs from both domains.

It's important to note that this solution might not always be the best choice in all scenarios as it requires more computational resources and time compared to other solutions like using a single neural network or hybrid architectures. However, when dealing with complex and distinct domains, separating the models can provide better accuracy and generalization capabilities.
