 ## Problem Statement

A research group is working on developing a neural network-based solution for a natural language processing task. They have collected a large dataset of customer reviews, each labeled as positive or negative. The goal is to build a feed-forward neural network that can classify new reviews based on this training data.

However, they encounter a problem with the XOR function, which has been identified as a crucial building block for their model. They are unable to train a feed-forward neural network using only XOR functions as hidden units due to the vanishing gradient problem.

The team discusses several potential solutions:
1. Replacing XOR functions with sigmoid functions in the hidden layer.
2. Introducing radial basis function (RBF) neurons into their model.
3. Using a recurrent neural network for this task instead.
4. Utilizing convolutional neural networks to extract relevant features from reviews.
5. Implementing a long short-term memory (LSTM) network to handle the sequence of words in the reviews.

Which approach should the team take to build a feed-forward neural network that can effectively classify customer reviews while addressing the XOR problem?

## Choices
1. Replace all XOR functions with sigmoid functions in the hidden layer.
2. Introduce RBF neurons into the hidden layer instead of XOR functions.
3. Use a recurrent neural network to handle the sequence of words in the customer reviews.
4. Utilize convolutional neural networks to extract relevant features from the text data.
5. Implement a long short-term memory (LSTM) network as part of the feed-forward architecture.

## Solution
The team should implement a long short-term memory (LSTM) network as part of their feed-forward architecture. LSTMs are a type of recurrent neural network that can effectively handle sequence data while mitigating the vanishing gradient problem. Incorporating an LSTM layer into the feed-forward neural network allows them to address the XOR problem and improve the model's ability to classify customer reviews.

## Reasoning
LSTMs are designed to remember long-term dependencies in data, making them an ideal choice when working with sequence data like text or speech. Unlike traditional RNNs, LSTMs have a gating mechanism that can selectively retain important information while discarding irrelevant details. This makes LSTM networks more robust and able to handle longer sequences effectively.

The team's problem involves classifying customer reviews based on labeled training data. Since the text in each review is inherently sequential, an LSTM network would be a suitable solution. Moreover, by incorporating the LSTM layer into their feed-forward neural network architecture, they can leverage its capabilities to address the XOR problem and improve the model's overall performance without discarding or modifying existing XOR functions.

While sigmoid functions, RBF neurons, convolutional neural networks, and other approaches have their merits in specific scenarios, none of them directly addresses the XOR problem in a feed-forward neural network architecture while improving its ability to classify customer reviews effectively.
