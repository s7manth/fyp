 ## Problem Statement

Consider a text corpus consisting of news articles from various sources. The goal is to preprocess this corpus to perform information retrieval tasks effectively. Preprocessing steps include text normalization, word tokenization, and lemmatization.

Given an input sentence: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog," which of the following preprocessing steps will result in the correct words and their corresponding lemmas or base forms?

## Choices
1. Word tokenization and text normalization, but not lemmatization.
2. Text normalization and word tokenization, followed by stemming.
3. Regular expressions for text normalization, word tokenization, and lemmatization using a pre-built resource.
4. Edit distance calculation for each word in the sentence, followed by word tokenization and lemmatization.
5. Simple Unix tools for text normalization, followed by manual lemmatization.

## Solution
The correct answer is 1: Word tokenization and text normalization, but not lemmatization.

Here's the reasoning behind this:

Word tokenization and text normalization are essential preprocessing steps in natural language processing. These steps help us divide a text into individual words (tokenization) and correct common errors like misspellings or inconsistent capitalizations (normalization). However, lemmatization is an optional step that transforms inflected forms of a word to their base or dictionary form (lemmas).

Given the input sentence "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog," the initial preprocessing steps would be:
1. Text normalization: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
2. Word tokenization: ['The', 'quick', 'brown', 'fox', 'jumps', 'over', 'the', 'lazy', 'dog']

In this example, there are no inflected forms in the sentence that need to be transformed into their base form using lemmatization. Therefore, it's unnecessary to apply lemmatization at this stage.

Choices 2, 3, 4, and 5 include incorrect combinations of preprocessing steps. For instance, option 2 suggests text normalization and word tokenization followed by stemming. However, stemming is not the same as lemmatization (lemma being a more accurate base form than a stem). Option 3 mentions regular expressions for text normalization along with word tokenization and lemmatization, but regular expressions are not necessary for these tasks. Option 4 discusses edit distance calculation for each word in the sentence followed by word tokenization and lemmatization, which is incorrect because edit distance calculation is a method used to measure similarity between strings, not a preprocessing step. Lastly, option 5 suggests using simple Unix tools for text normalization followed by manual lemmatization. While Unix tools can help with text normalization, manual lemmatization is time-consuming and impractical for large datasets.
