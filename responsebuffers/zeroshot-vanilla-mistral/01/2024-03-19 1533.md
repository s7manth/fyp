 ## Problem Statement

Consider a large corpus of customer reviews for an e-commerce website, where each review is represented as a single line of text. The goal is to develop a pipeline that performs the following text processing tasks:

1. Word tokenization using simple Unix tools and regular expressions
2. Text normalization by removing stopwords, punctuation marks, and converting all words to lowercase
3. Lemmatization or stemming of each word in the review
4. Calculate edit distance between pairs of reviews to determine their similarity
5. Perform sentence segmentation to analyze reviews at a finer granularity

Given the following inputs, determine which pipeline best fits the requirements:

Input 1: A simple shell script for tokenization using `grep`, `awk`, and regular expressions
Input 2: A Python script that uses NLTK library for tokenization, text normalization, and lemmatization
Input 3: A Perl script that performs tokenization using a custom-built lexicon, text normalization with custom rules, and Porter stemming algorithm
Input 4: A combination of Input 1 and Input 2 with slight modifications to the scripts for improved performance
Input 5: A combination of Inputs 1, 2, and 3 with the addition of a Java-based tool for sentence segmentation

## Choices

1. Input 1 is the best choice because it only uses simple Unix tools and regular expressions for tokenization, which is the most efficient solution.
2. Input 2 is the best choice because it provides comprehensive text processing capabilities with NLTK library.
3. Input 3 is the best choice because it offers custom rules for text normalization and the Porter stemming algorithm for better accuracy.
4. Input 4 is the best choice because it combines the simplicity of Unix tools with the advanced capabilities of Python libraries.
5. Input 5 is the best choice because it provides all the required features, including tokenization, text normalization, lemmatization/stemming, edit distance calculation, and sentence segmentation.

## Solution

The correct answer is Input 5 because it offers a complete pipeline that includes all the mentioned text processing tasks (tokenization, text normalization, lemmatization/stemming, edit distance calculation, and sentence segmentation) from various sources (simple Unix tools, Python libraries, Perl script, and a Java-based tool).

## Reasoning

The goal is to find the pipeline that best fits the requirements. Each input provides different text processing capabilities:

1. Input 1 uses only simple Unix tools (`grep`, `awk`, and regular expressions) for word tokenization, but it lacks advanced features such as text normalization or lemmatization/stemming.
2. Input 2 is written in Python and uses the NLTK library to perform tokenization, text normalization, and lemmatization. While it offers comprehensive capabilities, its performance may not be optimal for large corpora due to the overhead of Python libraries.
3. Input 3 is written in Perl and provides custom rules for text normalization along with the Porter stemming algorithm. It also has a specific focus on tokenization using a custom-built lexicon, but it lacks advanced features such as sentence segmentation or edit distance calculation.
4. Input 4 combines Input 1 and Input 2 by making slight modifications to their respective scripts for improved performance. While it provides the advantages of both solutions, it may not cover all the required text processing tasks (sentence segmentation) thoroughly.
5. Input 5 is a combination of Inputs 1, 2, and 3 with the addition of a Java-based tool for sentence segmentation. It offers all the mentioned text processing tasks and provides flexibility through the use of multiple programming languages and tools. Thus, it is the best choice to meet the requirements.
