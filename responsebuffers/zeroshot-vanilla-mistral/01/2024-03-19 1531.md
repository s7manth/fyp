## Problem Statement

Given a text corpus obtained from web scraping, preprocess the data using various natural language processing techniques to ensure consistency and comparability. Choose the correct sequence of steps based on the following options:

1. Remove stopwords using a predefined list.
2. Perform word tokenization using Unix tools.
3. Apply simple stemming.
4. Normalize text by converting all characters to lowercase.
5. Segment sentences using an appropriate model.
6. Perform lemmatization instead of stemming.
7. Remove special characters and perform text normalization.
8. Apply edit distance calculation for word comparison.
9. Use regular expressions for advanced pattern matching in the text data.
10. Perform word tokenization using NLTK library instead of Unix tools.

## Choices

1. 7, 4, 1, 5, 6, 10, 2, 3, 8, 9
2. 1, 4, 7, 5, 6, 10, 2, 3, 8, 9
3. 1, 4, 7, 5, 9, 10, 2, 3, 6, 8
4. 1, 4, 7, 5, 6, 3, 2, 9, 8, 10
5. 1, 4, 7, 5, 6, 8, 9, 2, 3, 10

## Solution

The correct sequence of steps is: 1, 4, 7, 5, 6, 3, 8, 9, 10, 2. Here's why:

First, we should perform text normalization by converting all characters to lowercase (Step 4) to ensure consistency in our data processing. Next, we apply text preprocessing techniques such as removing stopwords (Step 1), removing special characters (Step 7), and performing word tokenization using Unix tools (Step 5).

Afterward, it's important to normalize words by either applying stemming or lemmatization. Since the problem statement mentions both techniques, let's first apply simple stemming (Step 6) for simplicity before exploring more complex transformations.

Next, we perform word tokenization using NLTK library instead of Unix tools (Step 10) to explore more advanced text processing techniques. This step helps ensure that the word tokenization is performed accurately and efficiently.

Now, we can apply more advanced text processing techniques like edit distance calculation for word comparison (Step 8), which enables us to find the difference between words and determine their similarity. In addition, using regular expressions for pattern matching in the text data (Step 9) provides further flexibility and control over the text preprocessing pipeline.

Finally, we segment sentences using an appropriate model (Step 5). The reason for doing this step last is that sentence segmentation is typically a more complex task than word processing and can benefit from having consistent words to work with beforehand.

## Reasoning

The correct sequence of steps is based on the following considerations:

1. Text normalization should be performed first as it ensures consistency across all data points.
2. Preprocessing techniques like stopword removal, text normalization, and word tokenization are essential for preparing text data for further processing.
3. Stemming and lemmatization help in reducing words to their base form, making the data easier to analyze.
4. More advanced text processing techniques like edit distance calculation and regular expressions can be applied later in the pipeline to explore more complex relationships between words and patterns in the text data.
5. Sentence segmentation is a more complex task that benefits from having consistent and preprocessed word data beforehand.
