 ## Problem Statement

Given a dataset of customer reviews for a restaurant, where each review is labeled as positive or negative, apply a machine learning model to classify new, unlabeled reviews. You have access to various natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms covered in the course, including Logistic Regression, Multinomial logistic regression, and Gradient Descent with regularization.

## Choices

1. Apply Logistic Regression directly on the bag-of-words representation of the reviews without any preprocessing or feature engineering.
2. Preprocess the text data by removing stop words, applying stemming, and then use Multinomial logistic regression for classification.
3. Use Gradient Descent with regularization to learn the logistic regression model from scratch on the raw text data (without any feature engineering).
4. Perform text preprocessing and feature engineering by extracting TF-IDF features, and then apply Multinomial logistic regression for classification.
5. Use Logistic Regression with one-hot encoded word representations for classification without any further processing or optimization.

## Solution

Let's consider each choice in detail:

1. Applying Logistic Regression directly on the bag-of-words representation of the reviews might not be effective, as words appearing more frequently may overshadow less frequent but significant words, leading to poor classification performance.

2. Preprocessing the text data by removing stop words and applying stemming is a good practice for reducing dimensionality and noise in the feature space. Multinomial logistic regression is an appropriate choice here because it models the distribution of each class (positive or negative) over the vocabulary, making it more suitable for handling large feature spaces.

3. Using Gradient Descent with regularization to learn the logistic regression model from scratch on raw text data is a time-consuming and computationally expensive process, especially when dealing with large text corpora. In this case, using pre-trained models or existing NLP libraries can save significant computational resources and provide more accurate results.

4. Extracting TF-IDF features from the text data helps to capture the importance of each word in the document while reducing its dimensionality by considering the frequency of occurrence across multiple documents. Multinomial logistic regression is still a suitable choice for handling large feature spaces and providing reasonable classification performance.

5. Using Logistic Regression with one-hot encoded word representations can be effective but computationally expensive, as each review will have a feature vector with a length equal to the size of the vocabulary. This approach may not scale well to large text corpora. In practice, other NLP techniques such as bag-of-words or TF-IDF are often used instead for handling high-dimensional text data.

## Reasoning

To classify text data effectively, it's essential to apply appropriate preprocessing and feature engineering techniques before feeding the data into a machine learning model. Choices that involve preprocessing (such as removing stop words and applying stemming) and feature engineering (like extracting TF-IDF features) are preferred over directly applying Logistic Regression or Multinomial logistic regression to raw text data, which can lead to poor performance due to the high dimensionality of text data.

Moreover, using Gradient Descent with regularization to learn the logistic regression model from scratch on raw text data is computationally expensive and not practical for handling large text corpora. In contrast, using pre-trained models or existing NLP libraries can save significant computational resources while providing more accurate results.

The choice that applies Multinomial logistic regression to the preprocessed and TF-IDF engineered text data is a good overall solution for this problem statement. However, it's essential to understand the reasoning behind each choice to gain a deep understanding of various NLP techniques and their practical applications.
