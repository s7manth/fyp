## Problem Statement

Suppose you are given a dataset of customer reviews for a new product, and your goal is to build a text classification model to predict whether each review expresses a positive or negative sentiment. You have decided to use multinomial logistic regression as your classifier.

Before training the model, you need to perform some preprocessing steps on the data. In particular, you must apply feature extraction using bag-of-words representation and remove stop words from the dataset.

Given this context, answer the following question:

## Choices
1. Which learning algorithm should be used for multinomial logistic regression?
2. How does the sigmoid function relate to the output of a logistic regression model?
3. What is regularization, and how does it help in preventing overfitting during training?
4. After feature extraction and stop word removal, which representation should be used for inputting the data into the multinomial logistic regression algorithm?
5. How does the cross-entropy loss function differ from other common loss functions like mean squared error or hinge loss when used with a logistic regression model?

## Solution

1. **Answer: Gradient Descent**
   * Explanation: Multinomial logistic regression is a type of logistic regression, and the learning algorithm for both types is gradient descent. Although it's not explicitly stated in the problem, the intent is to use multinomial logistic regression with gradient descent for training.

2. **Answer: The output of a logistic regression model is passed through a sigmoid function to obtain probabilities between 0 and 1.**
   * Explanation: Logistic regression is used to predict the probability of a binary outcome based on input features. The sigmoid function, denoted by $sigmoid(z) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-z}}$, is a mathematical function that transforms the linear output of logistic regression into probabilities.

3. **Answer: Regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function to prevent overfitting.**
   * Explanation: During training, logistic regression models can sometimes learn the noise in the data instead of the underlying patterns, leading to poor generalization performance on unseen data. Regularization introduces a penalty term to the loss function, which discourages large model coefficients and encourages smaller ones, thereby reducing overfitting.

4. **Answer: The bag-of-words representation after stop word removal should be used as input for multinomial logistic regression.**
   * Explanation: Bag-of-words representation is a common feature extraction technique for text data that involves converting words in the text into numerical vectors. After removing stop words, the resulting dataset will consist of features (words) and their corresponding counts. This representation is suitable for multinomial logistic regression, which models probability distributions over classes based on the presence or absence of individual words in a review.

5. **Answer: The cross-entropy loss function measures the average number of bits required to represent the ground truth labels and predicted probabilities.**
   * Explanation: Commonly used for multiclass classification tasks, cross-entropy loss is calculated as $- \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{j=1}^{C} y_{ij} log(p_j)$, where $N$ is the number of instances in the dataset, $y_{ij}$ is the ground truth label for the $i$-th instance and $j$-th class, and $p_j$ is the predicted probability for the same pair. Cross-entropy loss differs from other common loss functions like mean squared error or hinge loss because it takes into account the probabilities of each class and penalizes incorrect predictions more severely when they have higher predicted probabilities.
