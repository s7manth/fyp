 ## Problem Statement

Consider a natural language processing task where we are given a collection of customer reviews for various products, and our goal is to classify each review as positive or negative based on its text. We will use logistic regression with multinomial features for this task.

Given the following conditions:
1. Our feature representation consists of the bag-of-words model, resulting in a multinomial distribution over word counts per document.
2. The sigmoid function is used as the activation function to apply nonlinearity.
3. Regularization is employed to prevent overfitting, and we're using L2 regularization.
4. Learning takes place via gradient descent with a mini-batch size of 10.
5. Our dataset consists of 1,000 documents (500 positive reviews and 500 negative reviews).

With these conditions in mind, determine which of the following statements is true regarding our classification setup:

## Choices
1. During gradient descent, the learning rate is not updated throughout the iterations.
2. The sigmoid function is applied element-wise to the feature vectors before making predictions.
3. Multinomial logistic regression only considers binary classes and cannot be used for multi-class problems.
4. L2 regularization adds an additional loss term based on the square root of the feature weights.
5. The cross-entropy loss function is calculated over all documents in a mini-batch during gradient descent.

## Solution
Let's evaluate each choice:

1. False. During gradient descent, the learning rate is updated after each iteration or epoch to help convergence or improve performance.
2. True. The sigmoid function is applied element-wise to the feature vectors before making predictions, transforming their linear output into a nonlinear probabilistic output.
3. False. Multinomial logistic regression can be used for multi-class problems by generalizing binary classification to multiple classes through the softmax activation function and one-vs-all method.
4. False. L2 regularization adds an additional loss term based on the sum of the squares of the feature weights, not their square root.
5. True. The cross-entropy loss function is calculated over all documents in a mini-batch during gradient descent to compute an average loss for that batch and help improve convergence.

## Reasoning
1. False: In gradient descent, we update the learning rate based on the performance of the model or the change in the cost function. This allows us to adaptively adjust our learning process as needed.
2. True: Element-wise application of the sigmoid function is a common practice during logistic regression because it transforms linear output into probabilistic output that can be interpreted as class probabilities.
3. False: Multinomial logistic regression extends logistic regression to multi-class problems, allowing us to handle more complex datasets with diverse categorical variables.
4. False: L2 regularization adds a term (lambda) to the cost function that penalizes large feature weights in order to reduce model complexity and improve generalization performance.
5. True: In mini-batch gradient descent, we calculate the cross-entropy loss for all documents in a mini-batch before averaging it to get a single loss value for that iteration. This allows us to stably update our weights and biases while retaining some memory of the entire dataset.
