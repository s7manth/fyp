## Question
Consider you are designing a language model for a small-scale mobile typing assistant that suggests the next word as the user types, aiming to strike a balance between model complexity and efficiency. After conducting various experiments with N-gram models, you decide to evaluate these models based on their perplexity on a held-out test set. Given the constraints of a mobile application, such as limited storage and processing power, you prefer a model with lower complexity, provided it maintains acceptable performance. Based on the experiment results below, which N-gram model would you select, and why?

1. Unigram Model with Perplexity: 800
2. Bigram Model with Perplexity: 200
3. Trigram Model with Perplexity: 150
4. Quadgram Model with Perplexity: 140
5. Pentagram Model with Perplexity: 138

## Solution
To select the most suitable model, we need to analyze the trade-off between model complexity and performance, measured by perplexity in this case. Perplexity is a measure of how well a probability model predicts a sample. A lower perplexity indicates a better predictive performance.

- **Unigram Model (Option 1)** has the highest perplexity, suggesting it is the least capable of accurately predicting the next word. Despite its simplicity and low computational requirements, its performance may not be sufficient for a good user experience.

- **Bigram Model (Option 2)** shows a significant improvement over the unigram model, reducing perplexity to 200. This suggests much better predictive accuracy with still relatively low complexity, making it a potentially good balance between performance and computational efficiency.

- **Trigram Model (Option 3)** further decreases perplexity to 150, indicating improved performance. The increase in model complexity (storage and processing) is moderate when moving from a bigram to a trigram model.

- **Quadgram Model (Option 4)** and **Pentagram Model (Option 5)** continue to decrease perplexity to 140 and 138, respectively. These improvements, however, are diminishing as the n increases from tri- to pentagrams. The slight decrease in perplexity comes at the cost of significantly increased model complexity due to the exponential growth in the number of parameters (n-grams) that need to be stored and computed.

Considering the mobile context, where storage and computational resources are limited, the trigram model stands out as an appealing choice. It significantly outperforms simpler models (unigram and bigram) while avoiding the steep increases in complexity associated with quadgram and pentagram models. The incremental benefit in perplexity reduction from trigram to higher n-grams is minimal compared to the increase in complexity, making the trigram model the optimal balance between efficiency and performance in this scenario.

## Correct Answer
3. Trigram Model with Perplexity: 150

## Reasoning
The trigram model is chosen based on an analysis that balances model complexity with performance, measured by perplexity. It offers a significant improvement in performance over unigram and bigram models, indicative of its better predictive accuracy, without the marked increase in complexity seen in quadgram and pentagram models. This makes the trigram model well-suited for applications where there are constraints on computational resources, such as a mobile typing assistant. The decision highlights the importance of considering both technical limitations and user experience in choosing an N-gram model for practical applications.
