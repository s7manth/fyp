## Question
A team of data scientists is developing a sentiment analysis model using a Naive Bayes classifier. To ensure the model's performance is robust and reliable, they plan to evaluate it using precision, recall, and F-measure. After the initial development phase, the team conducted an evaluation and obtained the following results from the test set: 

- Precision: 0.78
- Recall: 0.65
- F-measure: 0.71

Considering the results, the data scientists decide to modify their approach to improve the model's performance. Which of the following actions is most likely to **increase the recall** of the sentiment analysis model without necessarily maintaining the current precision?

1. Increase the size of the training dataset by including more labeled instances from various sources.
2. Apply feature selection to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space, eliminating noisy or irrelevant features.
3. Modify the Naive Bayes classifier to decrease the threshold for classifying a text as positive sentiment.
4. Increase the weight of the precision in the F-measure calculation.
5. Utilize a more complex model like a deep neural network instead of Naive Bayes.

## Solution
To understand how to increase the recall of the sentiment analysis model developed with a Naive Bayes classifier, we must first understand what recall represents. Recall, also known as sensitivity or true positive rate, measures the proportion of actual positives that are correctly identified. Therefore, increasing the recall involves correctly identifying a larger proportion of positive sentiment texts as positive.

Option 3, "Modify the Naive Bayes classifier to decrease the threshold for classifying a text as positive sentiment," directly addresses the objective of increasing recall. By decreasing the classification threshold for positives, the model is more likely to label texts as positive, including those that might have been missed (false negatives) previously. This action increases the number of true positives and hence the recall. However, it is important to note that doing so might also increase the number of false positives, potentially lowering the precision, but the question explicitly allows for this trade-off.

Option 1 might potentially improve the overall performance of the model but does not specifically target the recall metric. Option 2, applying feature selection, might improve the model by removing noise but does not guarantee an increase in recall. Option 4, increasing the weight of the precision in the F-measure calculation, affects the evaluation metric and does not directly impact the model's recall. Option 5 suggests switching to a more complex model, which might or might not improve recall and is not a direct approach to addressing the specified problem.

## Correct Answer
3. Modify the Naive Bayes classifier to decrease the threshold for classifying a text as positive sentiment.

## Reasoning
Recall is increased by correctly identifying more true positives, which can be effectively achieved by lowering the threshold for classifying instances as positive. This approach directly impacts the recall metric by potentially allowing more positive cases to be correctly recognized, albeit at a potential cost to precision, in line with the trade-offs usually observed between these two metrics. The aim is to make the model less stringent in classifying texts as expressing positive sentiment, thereby reducing the chances of missing positive instances (decreasing false negatives). Other options might influence model performance in broader terms but do not specifically target or guarantee an improvement in recall the way option 3 does.
