## Question
You are designing a sentiment analysis system to detect the sentiment of customer reviews on a new e-commerce platform. You decide to use a Naive Bayes Classifier because of its simplicity and effectiveness for text classification tasks. You remember that while Naive Bayes is easy to implement and fast, its assumption of feature independence can sometimes affect its performance. Given this context, which of the following strategies would most effectively optimize a Naive Bayes Classifier for sentiment analysis, ensuring it can handle negations and context-dependent sentiment expressions while maintaining computational efficiency?

1. Increase the size of the training dataset to include a wider variety of expressions and negations, ensuring the model captures more context.
2. Apply a bag-of-words model with bi-gram or tri-gram features to capture phrase-level sentiment expressions more effectively.
3. Utilize dimensionality reduction techniques on the feature set to reduce the computational resources needed without considering the context.
4. Implement a deep learning-based sentiment analysis model instead of Naive Bayes to better handle complex language structures.
5. Use a lexicon-based approach in conjunction with Naive Bayes to incorporate sentiment scores of words and phrases directly into the model.

## Solution
To optimize a Naive Bayes Classifier for sentiment analysis, especially to handle negations ("not good") and context-dependent expressions ("good" vs. "not good at all"), one needs to capture the sequence in which words appear. While increasing the training data size (Option 1) can help in capturing more varied expressions, it doesn't directly address the issue of sequence or context. Dimensionality reduction (Option 3) focuses on computational efficiency but can strip away valuable context. Switching to a deep learning model (Option 4) might improve performance on complex language structures, but it diverges from the goal of optimizing the Naive Bayes model and also significantly increases computational complexity. Using a lexicon-based approach (Option 5) can enrich the model with sentiment scores, but it doesn't inherently solve the issue of understanding context or sequence of words as it mainly enriches the feature set with pre-determined sentiment values.

**The most effective strategy among the given options is Option 2, applying a bag-of-words model with bi-gram or tri-gram features.** This approach enables the model to recognize and differentiate between phrases like "not good" and "very good," which are crucial for accurate sentiment analysis. Bi-grams (pairs of consecutive words) and tri-grams (triplets of consecutive words) help capture contexts where the sentiment is significantly affected by the combination of words, without dramatically increasing the model's complexity compared to deep learning solutions.

## Correct Answer
2. Apply a bag-of-words model with bi-gram or tri-gram features to capture phrase-level sentiment expressions more effectively.

## Reasoning
By incorporating bi-gram or tri-gram features into the Naive Bayes Classifier, one can somewhat mitigate the model's limitation regarding the independence assumption. This strategy directly addresses the need to understand the sentiment expression in the context of negations and phrases that inherently carry different sentiments when words are combined. Furthermore, this method preserves the simplicity and computational efficiency of the Naive Bayes Classifier, making it a balanced and effective solution for optimizing sentiment analysis tasks. It provides a pragmatic approach to enhancing the model's capability to process and analyze text data more accurately without resorting to more complex and computationally intensive methods.
