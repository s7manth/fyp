## Question

Regular Expressions, Text Normalization, Edit Distance, Words, Corpora, Simple Unix Tools for Word Tokenization, Word Tokenization, Word Normalization, Lemmatization, Stemming, and Sentence Segmentation are all techniques used in Natural Language Processing (NLP).

Which of the following NLP tasks can these techniques be applied to?

1. Information extraction
2. Text classification
3. Sentiment analysis
4. Named entity recognition
5. Machine Translation

## Solution

The correct answer is: 2. Text Classification

Reasoning:

Regular Expressions can be used for text pattern matching, which is useful in text classification tasks. Text normalization techniques such as lowercasing and tokenization can also help improve the accuracy of text classification models. Edit distance measures such as Levenshtein distance or Jaro-Winkler distance can be used to compare the similarity between two texts, which can be helpful in text classification. Words and corpora are the basic building blocks of text data, which is essential for text classification. Simple Unix tools for word tokenization and word normalization can preprocess text data for classification. Lemmatization and stemming can reduce words to their base form, reducing the dimensionality of the data and improving the model's performance. Sentence segmentation can help classify texts at the sentence level, which is crucial in text classification tasks.

Therefore, options 1, 3, 4, and 5 are incorrect because they do not relate to the application of the listed techniques. Option 2, text classification, is the best fit since it aligns with the given techniques' applications.

## Correct Answer

2. Text Classification

## Reasoning

The reasoning for this question required a synthesis of ideas from various sources, including the textbook, research papers, and lectures. It also required critical analysis and problem-solving skills to evaluate the applicability of each technique in natural language processing tasks, particularly in text classification.
