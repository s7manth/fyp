## Question
In the analysis of a given text fragment, "The bank can guarantee deposits will eventually cover future tuition costs because it invests in bonds that are sure to mature," a text mining algorithm strives to understand the meanings and relationships of words within the sentence. Among the techniques available, which one would be most useful for identifying the specific role that "bank" plays in the sentence, distinguishing it from other potential meanings of "bank"?

1. Constituency Parsing
2. Dependency Parsing
3. Sentence Structure and Word Meanings Analysis
4. Word Semantics with WordNet
5. Both Dependency Parsing and Word Semantics with WordNet

## Solution
To identify the specific role that "bank" plays in the given sentence and distinguish it from other potential meanings (e.g., the side of a river vs. a financial institution), we need a combination of techniques that analyze the grammatical structure of the sentence and understand the contextual meaning of words.

- **Constituency Parsing** breaks the sentence into sub-phrases but does not explicitly reveal the functions or relationships between words.
- **Dependency Parsing**, on the other hand, builds a tree that represents grammatical relations between words, showing how "bank" functions in relation to other words like "can guarantee." This helps in understanding the role of "bank" within its immediate context.
- **Sentence Structure and Word Meanings Analysis** could involve looking at individual word meanings and general sentence structure, but it might not provide a clear disambiguation of "bank" without understanding its grammatical relations.
- **Word Semantics with WordNet** involves checking the word "bank" against a lexical database to understand its different senses (meanings). While this can hint at the possible meanings, it cannot by itself determine which meaning is relevant in the given context without examining the sentence's structure.

Therefore, the most effective approach combines **Dependency Parsing** to understand the grammatical relationships and **Word Semantics with WordNet** to disambiguate "bank" based on those relationships.

Hence, the correct answer is:

5. Both Dependency Parsing and Word Semantics with WordNet

## Correct Answer
5. Both Dependency Parsing and Word Semantics with WordNet

## Reasoning
The reasoning behind combining **Dependency Parsing** and **Word Semantics with WordNet** lies in addressing two main aspects: grammatical structure and semantic meaning. Dependency Parsing helps delineate the syntactic structure of the sentence, mapping out relationships that indicate how words are related to and affect each other's meanings. This creates a framework within which the meaning of "bank" can be more precisely inferred. For example, understanding that "bank" is the subject of "can guarantee" aligns with its role as an entity capable of such action, which corresponds more closely to a financial institution than to the side of a river.

Leveraging **Word Semantics with WordNet** then allows us to delve into the semantic layer, where the context provided by dependency parsing helps narrow down the correct sense of "bank." Since WordNet lists possible meanings (senses) of words, the grammatical cues identified through dependency parsing can guide the selection of "bank" as a financial institution rather than any of its other meanings. This synergy between parsing for structure and consulting a lexical database for meaning represents a comprehensive approach to understanding and disambiguating words in complex sentences.
