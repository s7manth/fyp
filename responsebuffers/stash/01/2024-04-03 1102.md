## Question
You are working on a text classification project involving movie reviews. The reviews are stored as strings in a Python list. Your task is to preprocess these reviews for sentiment analysis. The preprocessing steps you've decided to perform include lowercasing all words, removing punctuation, and splitting the text into individual words (tokenization). Given a review `review = "Wow! The movie was fantastic. Definitely a must-watch."`, which of the following code snippets correctly implements these preprocessing steps?

1. 
    ```python
    import re
    tokens = re.sub(r'\W+', ' ', review.lower()).split()
    ```

2. 
    ```python
    review.lower().replace(".", "").replace("!", "").split(" ")
    ```

3. 
    ```python
    import re
    tokens = re.split(r'\s+', review.lower())
    ```

4. 
    ```python
    review.lower().split(" ")
    ```

5. 
    ```python
    import string
    tokens = review.lower().translate(str.maketrans('', '', string.punctuation)).split()
    ```

## Solution

To solve this question, let's break down the requirements:

- **Lowercasing all words**: This can be done using the `.lower()` method on the review string.
- **Removing punctuation**: This requires identifying and removing characters like `!`, `.`, `,`, etc. This can be done using the `re.sub()` method from the `re` module with a regular expression that matches non-word characters (`\W+`), or using the `.translate()` method with a translation table that removes punctuation.
- **Splitting the text into individual words (tokenization)**: This can be achieved with the `.split()` method, which splits a string into a list of words based on whitespace by default.

Given these steps, let's evaluate the choices:

1. This code snippet uses the `re.sub()` function with the pattern `\W+` to remove all non-word characters (including punctuation) and then lowercases the text with `.lower()`. Finally, it splits the processed string into tokens with `.split()`. This effectively performs all the required preprocessing tasks.

2. This snippet manually removes dots and exclamation marks and then lowercases the text. However, it doesn't remove all types of punctuation and uses a fixed space for splitting, which may not be reliable for all cases (e.g., multiple spaces). 

3. It uses `re.split()` to split the string based on spaces after lowercasing. However, it doesn't address the requirement to remove punctuation.

4. This simply lowercases the text and splits on spaces. It does not remove punctuation, failing one of the preprocessing steps.

5. This method uses the `translate()` function to remove punctuation properly and then lowercases and tokenizes the text efficiently. This approach covers all the preprocessing steps effectively.

## Correct Answer

5.

## Reasoning

Choice 5 is the correct answer because it accurately performs all the required preprocessing steps: it lowercases the review, removes all punctuation using the `translate()` function along with `str.maketrans()` to define the translation table, and finally, it tokenizes the text into individual words using the `.split()` method. This approach is both efficient and effective in preparing the review text for subsequent analysis, such as sentiment analysis, by ensuring the cleanliness and consistency of the input data.
