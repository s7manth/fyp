## Question

Consider you are developing a natural language processing (NLP) system to analyze customer feedback from a popular e-commerce platform. The feedback consists of text in various languages, but your initial focus is to preprocess English text to facilitate sentiment analysis. Your preprocessing pipeline includes tokenization, lowercasing, and removing stopwords. Additionally, you plan to use regular expressions to identify and tag specific patterns related to product mentions (e.g., model numbers like "X100", "Y300", and service tags like "Refund", "Warranty") for special analysis. Given the complexity of natural language, you decide to apply a regular expression to capture these patterns most effectively. 

Which of the following regular expressions would best identify and tag the mentioned model numbers and service tags within the feedback text, considering the need for accuracy and minimizing false matches?

1. `[A-Z]{1,3}\d{2,4}|\b(Refund|Warranty)\b`
2. `\b[A-Z]\d{3}\b|\b(Refund|Warranty)`
3. `[A-Z]+\d+|Refund|Warranty`
4. `\b[A-Z][0-9]+\b|\bRefund\b|\bWarranty\b`
5. `(?:\b[A-Z]{1,2}\d{3}\b|\(Refund|Warranty)\)`

## Solution

To select the correct regular expression, one must analyze the specific patterns mentioned and the key requirements: capturing model numbers like "X100" or "Y300" and service tags like "Refund" and "Warranty" with minimal false matches. 

- Model numbers pattern analysis: Model numbers consist of an uppercase letter(s) followed by numeric digits. The letters can be up to three in number ("X100", "Y300" indicate one or two letters followed by three digits, but the possibility of up to a three-letter prefix is mentioned), and digits can range from 2 to 4 in quantity.
- Service tags pattern analysis: "Refund" and "Warranty" are distinct words that must be matched entirely, requiring word boundary delimiters to avoid partial matches in larger strings (e.g., avoiding "refund" in "refunding").

Breaking down each option:

1. `[A-Z]{1,3}\d{2,4}|\b(Refund|Warranty)\b` accurately matches model numbers with 1 to 3 uppercase letters followed by 2 to 4 digits, and it correctly identifies "Refund" and "Warranty" as whole words due to the use of word boundary markers (`\b`).
2. `\b[A-Z]\d{3}\b|\b(Refund|Warranty)` only matches model numbers with exactly one uppercase letter followed by exactly three digits, missing out on patterns with less or more digits and those with 2 or 3 uppercase letters. It also fails to properly close the word boundary on "Warranty".
3. `[A-Z]+\d+|Refund|Warranty` can potentially match strings unrestrictedly long sequences of uppercase letters followed by one or more digits, leading to false positives. It does not enforce whole word matching for the service tags.
4. `\b[A-Z][0-9]+\b|\bRefund\b|\bWarranty\b` matches model numbers starting with one uppercase letter followed by one or more digits but does not account for model numbers starting with two or three letters.
5. `(?:\b[A-Z]{1,2}\d{3}\b|\(Refund|Warranty)\)` relies on non-capturing groups (not necessary here) and mistakenly uses `(` instead of `\b` before "Refund|Warranty", making this choice incorrect in terms of syntax for word boundaries.

## Correct Answer

1. `[A-Z]{1,3}\d{2,4}|\b(Refund|Warranty)\b`

## Reasoning

The correct choice is the one that accurately reflects the described characteristics of the patterns we wish to match: 

- The model numbersâ€™ pattern can begin with 1 to 3 uppercase letters, indicating a product series, followed by 2 to 4 digits, indicating a specific model within the series.
- The service tags "Refund" and "Warranty" must be identified as standalone words to prevent partial matching within longer strings.

Option 1 is the only regular expression that correctly identifies both types of patterns with the necessary specificity and minimizes the potential for false matches. It uses `{1,3}` to match between 1 and 3 uppercase letters and `{2,4}` to match between 2 and 4 digits, accurately covering the expected range of model numbers. The addition of `\b` around the service tags ensures these are matched as whole words, critical for avoiding false positives (e.g., matching "refund" in "refunding").
