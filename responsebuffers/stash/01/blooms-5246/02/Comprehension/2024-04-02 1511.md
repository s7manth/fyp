## Question
Given a complex sentence, "The committee approved the new policy after much deliberation," choose the correct statement regarding its linguistic analysis using concepts of constituency parsing, dependency parsing, and word semantics with WordNet.

1. Dependency parsing would identify "approved" as the root, indicating that it is the central action around which the sentence structure is organized, but would not provide information about phrase structure like NP (Noun Phrase) or VP (Verb Phrase).
2. Constituency parsing cannot determine the hierarchical structure or dependencies between words, such as the relationship between "committee" and "approved."
3. WordNet can be used to find synonyms for "approved" and "deliberation," but it cannot provide any syntactic information or parse tree structures for the sentence.
4. Dependency parsing inherently provides the synonyms and antonyms of all the words in the sentence by analyzing the grammatical relationships.
5. Constituency parsing and dependency parsing play identical roles in analyzing sentence structure, offering the exact same information but represented in different formats.

## Solution
To arrive at the correct answer, we need to understand what each of the mentioned concepts (constituency parsing, dependency parsing, and WordNet) does:

- **Constituency parsing:** This process breaks a text into its sub-phrases. These sub-phrases are not individual words but rather groups of words that together serve a function in the sentence. The result of constituency parsing is often visualized as a tree diagram, showing how smaller phrases combine to form larger ones, up to the complete sentence.

- **Dependency parsing:** Unlike constituency parsing, dependency parsing focuses on the relationships between words in a sentence. It assigns a single root and then defines how all other words connect to this root and to each other through dependencies. This method shows how the action of one word affects another, thereby establishing a "dependency" between them.

- **WordNet:** A lexical database for the English language that groups words into sets of synonyms called synsets. WordNet provides information about word meanings, synonyms, antonyms, and more but does not give syntactic or structural sentence information.

Analyzing the given options with this understanding, let's dissect them:

1. **Correct.** Dependency parsing identifies the main verb or action in a sentence as the root and shows how other elements are connected to it, without directly providing information about phrases like noun phrases (NP) or verb phrases (VP).

2. **Incorrect.** Constituency parsing does determine the hierarchical structure of a sentence and shows dependencies in terms of how phrases are structured together, not directly in terms of relationships between individual words.

3. **Correct.** WordNet indeed provides lexical information, including synonyms for words like "approved" and "deliberation", but does not offer syntactic parse trees or structures.

4. **Incorrect.** Dependency parsing focuses on grammatical relationships and dependencies between words in a sentence; it does not inherently provide synonyms or antonyms. This information is part of lexical databases like WordNet.

5. **Incorrect.** While both are parsing approaches, constituency and dependency parsing serve different purposes and provide different perspectives on sentence structure. Constituency parsing breaks down a sentence into its sub-phrase components, and dependency parsing outlines the relationships and dependencies between individual words.

## Correct Answer
1. Dependency parsing would identify "approved" as the root, indicating that it is the central action around which the sentence structure is organized, but would not provide information about phrase structure like NP (Noun Phrase) or VP (Verb Phrase).

## Reasoning
Given the explanations for what each concept does:
- **Constituency parsing** provides a hierarchical structure of phrases within a sentence. 
- **Dependency parsing** illustrates how words in a sentence are related to each other, with one word (typically the main verb) serving as the central node from which other connections are made. 
- **WordNet** is a resource for understanding word meanings and relationships but does not contribute to sentence structure analysis.
  
Therefore, the statement about dependency parsing correctly summarizes its application to the example sentence, emphasizing its role in identifying the central action and outlining the structuring of relationships between words without delving into phrase structure, as constituency parsing would.
