## Question
A data science team is working on a natural language processing project to classify customer reviews into five categories: Positive, Negative, Neutral, Query, and Feedback. They plan to use the k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm for this classification task. Considering their dataset contains a mix of short and long reviews, they decide to employ TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) as a feature extraction method to convert textual data into a numerical format before applying KNN. 

Which of the following steps correctly outlines their approach to preparing the data and applying KNN for the classification task?

1. Calculate TF-IDF values for each review, use cosine similarity to determine the nearest neighbors for a given review, and classify the review based on the majority category among its neighbors.
2. Transform all reviews into lower case, calculate TF values for each word in the reviews, apply KNN directly without calculating IDF values, and classify the review based on the average distance to its neighbors.
3. First apply KNN to classify the reviews into preliminary categories, calculate TF-IDF values for each preliminary category separately, and then reapply KNN for the final classification.
4. Create a binary occurrence matrix for each review, calculate Euclidean distance between reviews based on this matrix, use KNN to classify the reviews, and then apply TF-IDF to adjust the initial classifications.
5. Aggregate all reviews into a single corpus, calculate the global TF-IDF for this corpus, and then apply KNN to classify each review based on a pre-determined threshold for similarity scores.

## Solution

The correct approach to preparing the data and applying KNN for the classification task outlined in the options is to:

1. **Calculate TF-IDF values for each review**: This step is essential for transforming the textual data into a numerical format that can be processed by the KNN algorithm. TF-IDF helps in reflecting the importance of words in the reviews relative to the dataset, thereby providing a better feature set for classification.
  
2. **Use cosine similarity to determine the nearest neighbors for a given review**: After converting the reviews into a vector space model using TF-IDF, cosine similarity is an effective measure for finding the nearest neighbors in a high-dimensional space since it measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors. This similarity measure is beneficial for text data where the length of the documents (reviews in this case) can vary significantly.

3. **Classify the review based on the majority category among its neighbors**: KNN classifies an instance based on the majority category of its nearest neighbors. Hence, after identifying the nearest neighbors using cosine similarity, the review is assigned to the category that is most frequent among its k-nearest neighbors.

All these steps combined represent a comprehensive and effective approach to using KNN for classifying customer reviews into the specified categories using TF-IDF as the feature extraction method.

## Correct Answer

1. Calculate TF-IDF values for each review, use cosine similarity to determine the nearest neighbors for a given review, and classify the review based on the majority category among its neighbors.

## Reasoning

The proposed solution encapsulates a methodologically sound approach to text classification using KNN and TF-IDF, which aligns with the principles of similarity-based text mining methods. Specifically, the TF-IDF technique is adept at handling the variability in text length and significance of words across documents, which is crucial for preparing the data in a form that is suitable for KNN classification. Additionally, employing cosine similarity as a metric for finding nearest neighbors leverages the geometric properties of TF-IDF vectors, making it a suitable choice for text data. Lastly, the decision to classify based on the majority category among neighbors is a fundamental characteristic of the KNN algorithm, ensuring that the classification is influenced by the most similar reviews.
