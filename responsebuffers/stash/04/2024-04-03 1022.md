## Question

A data scientist is working on a project that involves classifying news articles into various categories such as Politics, Sports, Technology, and Business. The dataset consists of thousands of news articles in English, each labeled with one of these categories. To tackle this problem, the data scientist decides to use the K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm due to its simplicity and effectiveness in handling multi-class classification problems.

Before implementing the KNN algorithm, the scientist performs pre-processing steps on the text which include tokenization, stop words removal, and TF-IDF vectorization. They then plan to use the cosine similarity measure to determine the 'closeness' between articles.

Given this scenario, which of the following options best describes an appropriate approach to determine the category of a new, unlabeled news article using KNN?

1. Calculate the Euclidean distance between the TF-IDF vector of the new article and the vectors of all labeled articles in the dataset, pick the top K nearest neighbors based on the shortest distances, and assign the new article to the majority category among these neighbors.
2. Calculate the cosine similarity between the TF-IDF vector of the new article and the vectors of all labeled articles in the dataset, pick the top K nearest articles based on the highest similarity scores, and assign the new article to the majority category among these neighbors.
3. Calculate the Jaccard similarity between the set of keywords in the new article and the keyword sets of all labeled articles in the dataset, pick the top K nearest articles based on the highest similarity scores, and assign the new article to the majority category among these neighbors.
4. Use a decision tree algorithm to classify the new article based on the TF-IDF vectors of the labeled dataset, ignoring the nearest neighbor approach.
5. Perform clustering on the labeled dataset to create clusters of similar articles and assign the new article to the closest cluster based on the centroid's cosine similarity, disregarding the K-nearest neighbors entirely.

## Solution

To identify the most appropriate method to classify the new article using KNN, let's analyze each option considering the scenario specifics:

- **Option 1** talks about using Euclidean distance with TF-IDF vectors. While feasible, Euclidean distance is less effective for high-dimensional data like text because of the curse of dimensionality. It doesn't consider the angle between the vectors, which is crucial in text classification.

- **Option 2** outlines using cosine similarity with TF-IDF vectors, identifying the top K nearest articles by the highest similarity scores, and then classifying based on the majority category among these neighbors. This aligns well with text mining's standard practices since cosine similarity effectively measures the 'closeness' of documents in high-dimensional spaces by considering the angle between vectors, making it particularly suited for text data processed through TF-IDF.

- **Option 3** proposes using the Jaccard similarity based on keyword sets. While Jaccard similarity is a valid measure for comparing sets, the specificity and context of words (crucial in articles' classification) are better captured by vector space models like TF-IDF combined with cosine similarity.

- **Option 4** suggests switching algorithms to use a decision tree approach. While decision trees are valuable for certain types of classification problems, it deviates from the specified use of KNN in this scenario.

- **Option 5** mentions clustering as an approach. However, clustering is an unsupervised learning method used mainly for exploring dataset structures or segmenting datasets into clusters, not for classifying new instances based on existing labels.

Considering the analysis above, Option 2 is the most suitable approach for classifying the new article using the K-nearest neighbor algorithm in the context provided.

## Correct Answer

2. Calculate the cosine similarity between the TF-IDF vector of the new article and the vectors of all labeled articles in the dataset, pick the top K nearest articles based on the highest similarity scores, and assign the new article to the majority category among these neighbors.

## Reasoning

The reasoning behind choosing Option 2 is twofold:

1. **Suitability of Cosine Similarity:** In text mining, especially with high-dimensional data like text documents vectorized through TF-IDF, cosine similarity is often more appropriate than Euclidean distance. It measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors, effectively capturing the directional (rather than magnitude) similarity between documents. This characteristic makes it highly suitable for text classification tasks where the relative occurrence of terms (directions) is more important than their absolute numerical differences (magnitudes).

2. **Alignment with KNN Approach:** KNN classifies an instance based on the majority vote of its neighbors, with the instance being assigned to the most common class among its K nearest neighbors. By identifying the K nearest articles based on the highest cosine similarity scores with the TF-IDF vector of the new article, the method directly leverages the KNN principle, allowing for an accurate and effective classification based on the labeled dataset's existing knowledge.
