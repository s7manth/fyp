## Question
You are working on a sentiment analysis project that involves categorizing customer reviews into positive, neutral, and negative sentiments based on their textual content. You decide to use KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) as your classification model. You've pre-processed the text data, converted it into TF-IDF vectors, and now you're about to choose the value of K and the distance metric for the KNN classifier. Which of the following combinations of K value and distance metric is MOST LIKELY to result in a robust and accurate sentiment classification, assuming your dataset is moderately large and evenly distributed across the three classes?

1. K = 3 and Euclidean distance
2. K = 5 and Manhattan distance
3. K = 7 and Cosine similarity
4. K = 11 and Jaccard similarity
5. K = 15 and Euclidean distance

## Solution

To select the best combination of K value and distance metric for KNN in a text classification task such as sentiment analysis, itâ€™s essential to consider the nature of the data and the specifics of the classification problem.

### K Value:
- **Lower values of K (e.g., 3)** can make the model sensitive to noise in the dataset. In text data, where outliers or unusual texts might not truly represent a category, this sensitivity could lead to overfitting and poorer generalization.
- **Higher values of K (e.g., 15)** can help smooth out the decision boundary, making the model more resilient to noise. However, too high a value, especially in a dataset that is not very large or has an uneven class distribution, may lead to underfitting, where the model does not capture sufficient detail.
- **Moderate values of K (e.g., 5 or 7)** often provide a good balance, making the model robust to noise while still sensitive enough to the nuances in the text data for classification.

### Distance Metric:
- **Euclidean distance** measures the straight-line distance between points. While it's widely used, it may not be the most effective for high-dimensional data like TF-IDF vectors due to the curse of dimensionality.
- **Manhattan distance** measures the sum of absolute differences between points across dimensions. It can be useful but shares similar limitations with Euclidean distance in high-dimensional spaces.
- **Cosine similarity** measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors and is effectively used in text mining, as it captures the similarity in direction, which is often more relevant than magnitude in text data.
- **Jaccard similarity** measures the intersection over union of sample sets. It's useful for binary attribute presence data but less so for TF-IDF, which incorporates frequency and not just presence/absence.

Given the considerations above and the specifics of TF-IDF vectors in text classification:

- **K = 3 and Euclidean distance (Choice 1)** might lead to overfitting due to low K and dimensionality issues with Euclidean distance.
- **K = 5 and Manhattan distance (Choice 2)** offers a better K value, but Manhattan distance might not be optimal.
- **K = 7 and Cosine similarity (Choice 3)** provides a balanced K and uses a distance metric well-suited for text data, focusing on angular similarity rather than the magnitude, which can capture the nuances in text classification.
- **K = 11 and Jaccard similarity (Choice 4)** introduces a reasonable K value, but Jaccard similarity is less appropriate for TF-IDF vectors.
- **K = 15 and Euclidean distance (Choice 5)** risks underfitting with a high K value and suffers from the dimensionality issue of Euclidean distance.

## Correct Answer

3. K = 7 and Cosine similarity

## Reasoning

Choice 3 is the most suitable for several reasons:

- **K value**: 7 is a moderate value that ensures a good balance between sensitivity to noise and the ability to capture the nuances of the text data for accurate classification.
- **Distance Metric**: Cosine similarity is particularly effective for text mining tasks involving TF-IDF vectors. It allows the model to consider the orientation of the documents in the vector space rather than their magnitude, which is more informative for assessing textual similarity in sentiment analysis. This makes Choice 3 the most robust and accurate combination for classifying sentiments in customer reviews from a moderately large and evenly distributed dataset.
