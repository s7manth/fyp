## Question
You are tasked with preprocessing a large dataset of online product reviews to prepare for sentiment analysis. The reviews contain various textual inconsistencies that need to be addressed. One of the initial steps you decide to take is to use regular expressions (regex) to clean the data. Given the following common issues in the dataset, which regex pattern would be MOST effective in identifying and removing all HTML tags, allowing further preprocessing to proceed smoothly?

1. `/<[a-zA-Z]*>/`
2. `/<[^>]*>/`
3. `/<\/?[a-z]+\/?>/i`
4. `/<[a-zA-Z]+[^>]*>/`
5. `/<.*>/`

## Solution

The correct answer is 2. `/<[^>]*>/`.

To arrive at the correct answer, let's analyze each choice in light of what we know about HTML tags and regular expressions:

1. `/<[a-zA-Z]*>/` will match only the opening tags comprised entirely of letters and does not account for attributes within the tag or self-closing tags.
   
2. `/<[^>]*>/` matches any sequence starting with `<`, followed by any characters except `>`, and ending with `>`. This effectively captures the entire tag, including any attributes it might contain, without overspreading across multiple tags.

3. `/<\/?[a-z]+\/?>/i` is designed to match both opening and closing tags, including self-closing syntax, but it narrowly focuses on tags composed only of letters. This might omit tags with numbers or special characters in their names or fail to completely remove tags with complex attributes.

4. `/<[a-zA-Z]+[^>]*>/` attempts to match tags that start with letters but allows for any characters to follow until the closing `>`. While this correctly identifies tags and allows attributes, the initial requirement of starting with a letter (and only letters) before the attributes or tag close might miss some less standard but valid HTML tags.

5. `/<.*>/` is a greedy match that will start at the first `<` and continue until the last `>` in the string. This pattern risks capturing too much text, especially if there is legitimate text or other content between tags on the same line.

Given the analysis, choice 2 is best suited for removing HTML tags comprehensively without the risk of leaving artifacts behind or accidentally removing non-HTML content.

## Correct Answer

2. `/<[^>]*>/`

## Reasoning

The choice `/<[^>]*>/` adeptly uses a negated character class `[^>]` to match everything that's not a closing angle bracket `>`, ensuring that it captures everything within an HTML tag from the opening `<` to the closing `>`, including any attributes, without extending beyond the tag itself. This pattern is broad enough to capture all forms of HTML tags without making assumptions about the tags' composition, such as the presence of letters only or excluding tags with attributes, making it the ideal choice for the described scenario of cleaning HTML tags from product reviews in preparation for sentiment analysis.
