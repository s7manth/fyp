## Question

A data analyst is working on cleaning and preprocessing a dataset of user reviews from an online bookstore. The dataset contains numerous reviews, each of which is a string containing both the user's text review and a series of hashtags that describe the book genres (e.g., #Fantasy, #Romance). The analyst needs to preprocess these reviews for sentiment analysis but wants to first extract and separate the hashtags to use as labels for a genre classification model later.

Given a sample review: "Loved the intricate plot and dynamic characters! #Fantasy #Adventure", the analyst decides to use a regular expression to match and extract the hashtags.

Which of the following regular expressions should the analyst use to correctly identify and extract all the hashtags from the review?

1. `\w+#(\w+)`
2. `#\w+`
3. `#\S*`
4. `#[A-Za-z]+`
5. `^#\w+`

## Solution

The correct solution to extract all hashtags from the text is option 2: `#\w+`.

- **Step-by-Step Approach**:
  - **Identify the pattern**: Hashtags typically start with a `#` symbol and are followed by one or more word characters (letters, digits, or underscores). This means the pattern to match a hashtag should start with a `#` followed by the `\w` character class which matches any word character.
  - **Regular Expression Components**:
    - `#`: Matches the character `#` literally.
    - `\w+`: Matches one or more word characters. `\w` is equivalent to `[A-Za-z0-9_]`.
  - Given this pattern, a regular expression that fulfills these requirements is `#\w+`.

- **Explanation**:
  1. The first option `\w+#(\w+)` is incorrect because it looks for words that precede a `#`, plus it uses a capturing group for the text following the `#`, which is unnecessary for this task.
  2. The second option `#\w+` correctly identifies the sequence starting with a `#` followed by one or more word characters, thereby matching whole hashtags.
  3. The third option `#\S*` would also match non-word characters until it encounters a whitespace, which could potentially match more than intended if special characters are used in hashtags.
  4. The fourth option `#[A-Za-z]+` only matches hashtags that consist solely of alphabetic characters, excluding digits or underscores that could be part of a hashtag.
  5. The fifth option `^#\w+` is incorrect because the `^` character means that the regex would only match a hashtag if it is at the beginning of the string, which is not the requirement here.

## Correct Answer

2. `#\w+`

## Reasoning

The `\w+` after the `#` ensures that the regex looks for the `#` symbol followed by one or more word characters, effectively matching any hashtag. This option does not restrict hashtags to being only at the start of the text (as option 5 does) nor does it exclude hashtags with numbers or underscores (as option 4 does). Additionally, it specifically targets hashtags by including the `#` symbol at the start, unlike options 1 and 3, which have different target patterns that either do not match hashtags directly or are too broad. Therefore, `#\w+` is the most appropriate choice for the task of extracting hashtags from the text reviews.
