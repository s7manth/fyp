## Question
A data scientist is tasked with analyzing customer feedback from an online portal. The dataset consists of thousands of reviews in a semi-structured format. Reviews are classified into categories such as "Service", "Quality", and "Price". However, due to inconsistent submissions, some reviews are misclassified or uncategorized, and others might contain multiple categories in a single review. The goal is to process these reviews for an accurate sentiment analysis. Given this scenario, which of the following regular expressions would be most efficient for extracting reviews that contain references to more than one category, assuming categories are always enclosed in square brackets (e.g., "[Service]", "[Quality]") within the text? 

1. `\[.*\].*\[.*\]`
2. `\[(Service|Quality|Price)\].*\[(Service|Quality|Price)\]`
3. `(\[.*\]){2,}`
4. `\[[^\]]*\].*\[[^\]]*\]`
5. `\[Service\].*\[Quality\].*\[Price\]`

## Solution

Analyzing the question requires an understanding of regular expressions and their application in text preprocessing, specifically for the task of extracting specific patterns from text data. The question focuses on finding strings that have more than one category mentioned, with categories defined as being enclosed within square brackets.

**Option 1:** `\[.*\].*\[.*\]` 
- This regular expression will match any string that has two sets of square brackets with any characters in between. However, it's too generous and will match even if there's only one category mentioned alongside other non-category-related brackets in the text.

**Option 2:** `\[(Service|Quality|Price)\].*\[(Service|Quality|Price)\]` 
- This regex is more specific than option 1, targeting only the specified categories. It ensures that at least two of the categories mentioned (which could be the same or different) are found somewhere in the text, accounting for any characters in between. This option effectively filters out reviews with references to multiple specified categories.

**Option 3:** `(\[.*\]){2,}` 
- This pattern attempts to match any string that contains at least two occurrences of text within square brackets. Similar to option 1, it's very generous and might match strings that are not relevant, such as those with non-category-related text in brackets.

**Option 4:** `\[[^\]]*\].*\[[^\]]*\]` 
- This regular expression looks for two sets of characters enclosed in square brackets while avoiding greediness (using `[^]]` to stop at the first closing bracket it encounters). This makes it more precise in identifying categories specifically, as it doesn't overreach beyond the closing bracket of a category.

**Option 5:** `\[Service\].*\[Quality\].*\[Price\]` 
- This pattern is the most restrictive, requiring that the text contains all three mentioned categories in specific order. Given the problem statement, it is overly specific and fails to account for variations in order and the possibility of having only two categories mentioned.

## Correct Answer

4. `\[[^\]]*\].*\[[^\]]*\]`

## Reasoning

The correctness of option 4 is based on its specific targeting of the pattern relevant to the problem statement: identifying reviews with references to more than one category enclosed in square brackets. It accomplishes this by:
- Ensuring each match is bounded by square brackets, limiting matches to category-like strings.
- Being less greedy with its selection inside the brackets, making it more accurate for this context.
- Allowing for any characters to appear between the two category references, which is realistic given the unstructured nature of the reviews.

This regular expression strikes a balance between specificity (targeting the exact pattern needed) and flexibility (accounting for variability in text structure), making it the most efficient choice for extracting reviews that reference more than one category as described.
