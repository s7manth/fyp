## Question

Given a dataset of customer reviews, you are tasked with developing a predictive model that classifies each review into one of two categories: positive or negative. You decide to compare Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) models for this task. To enhance model performance, you plan to apply several preprocessing steps and feature extraction techniques. Considering the characteristics of these models and the nature of text data, which of the following strategies would be the most effective in improving the accuracy of **all** chosen models?

1. Apply stop word removal, perform stemming, and use TF-IDF for feature extraction without applying dimensionality reduction.
2. Perform tokenization and use one-hot encoding for feature extraction, followed by PCA for dimensionality reduction.
3. Use word embeddings as features without any preprocessing steps like stop word removal or stemming, relying on the model to implicitly handle these aspects.
4. Implement character level tokenization and use n-gram frequencies (with n=2 and n=3) for feature extraction, applying L2 normalization on the feature vectors.
5. Combine word embeddings with n-gram (with n=1 and n=2) TF-IDF weighted vectors, followed by feature selection through mutual information criteria.

## Solution

**Step-by-step approach:**

- **Understanding Model Characteristics:** 
  - **Naive Bayes**: Works well with high-dimensional data but assumes independence between features. It typically benefits from TF-IDF which helps in reducing the effect of common but less informative words.
  - **Logistic Regression**: Can handle sparse data well, making it suitable for text data, especially when enhanced with regularization. Feature scaling and selection can improve its performance.
  - **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)**: A neural network model that can capture complex relationships between features. It often benefits from dense input vectors, such as those derived from word embeddings, rather than sparse, high-dimensional data.

- **Evaluating Preprocessing and Feature Engineering Steps**:
  1. **Stop word removal** and **stemming** can help reduce dimensionality and noise for Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression but might remove contextual cues important for MLP.
  2. **TF-IDF** is effective for highlighting relevant words in sparse setups (good for Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression) but may not provide the dense representations preferred by MLP.
  3. **One-hot encoding** leads to very sparse and high-dimensional data, which might not be ideal for MLP.
  4. **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)** for dimensionality reduction can help Logistic Regression and potentially MLP but might distort the independence assumption critical for Naive Bayes.
  5. **Word embeddings** provide dense representations, beneficial for MLP, and can also improve Logistic Regression if combined with appropriate dimensionality reduction techniques. Their effectiveness for Naive Bayes is less clear due to the assumption of feature independence.
  6. **Character level tokenization and n-gram frequencies** could introduce useful syntactic features but might increase the feature space complexity unnecessarily.
  7. **Combining word embeddings with n-gram TF-IDF vectors** offers a rich feature set that bridges the gap between sparse and dense representations, potentially benefiting all models if done correctly.
  8. **Feature selection through mutual information criteria** can effectively identify relevant features, reducing noise and enhancing model performance across different architectures.

**Conclusion:** 
Option 5 is the most effective strategy. Combining word embeddings (providing dense, contextual features beneficial for MLP) with n-gram TF-IDF vectors (producing sparse, informative features helpful for both Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression) and applying feature selection (to refine the feature set for all models) is a comprehensive approach that targets the strengths and weaknesses of each model respectively.

## Correct Answer

5. Combine word embeddings with n-gram (with n=1 and n=2) TF-IDF weighted vectors, followed by feature selection through mutual information criteria.

## Reasoning

This option offers a nuanced synthesis of methods, leveraging the advantages of multiple preprocessing and feature extraction techniques:

- **Word Embeddings**: Provide dense, contextual information that is particularly beneficial for neural network approaches like MLP, yet also supports traditional models by offering a form of semantic understanding.
- **N-gram TF-IDF**: Captures local context and importance of terms in a way that is complementary to embeddings, benefiting models that rely on sparse representations like Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression. The use of both unigrams and bigrams (n=1 and n=2) allows capturing both individual keyword significance and context from adjacent word pairs.
- **Feature Selection via Mutual Information Criteria**: Ensures the models are not overwhelmed by the potentially large feature space resulting from the combined use of embeddings and TF-IDF. By selecting features that have the most mutual information with the target variable, it enhances the models' focus on relevant information, thereby potentially improving the accuracy of Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and MLP simultaneously.

This strategy carefully balances the needs for density and sparsity in feature representations while addressing the dimensionality and relevance of features in a manner that is conducive to performance improvements across all three model types considered.
