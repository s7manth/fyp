## Question
Given a document-term matrix of three documents, where the matrix represents term frequency (TF) counts in a simplified corpus of text, analyze the matrix and determine the cosine similarity between Document 1 and Document 2. Assume the term frequency counts are as follows:

$$
\begin{align*}
&\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \text{Term1} \ \ \ \ \text{Term2} \ \ \ \ \text{Term3} \ \ \ \ \text{Term4}\\
\text{Document 1} &\ \ \ \ 3 \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 0 \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 2 \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 4\\
\text{Document 2} &\ \ \ \ 1 \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 4 \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 0 \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 1\\
\text{Document 3} &\ \ \ \ 2 \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 1 \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 3 \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 1\\
\end{align*}
$$

Based on this matrix, what is the cosine similarity between Document 1 and Document 2?

1. 0.18
2. 0.25
3. 0.33
4. 0.42
5. 0.50

## Solution

First, calculate the dot product between the term frequency vectors of Document 1 and Document 2:

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Dot Product} &= (3 \times 1) + (0 \times 4) + (2 \times 0) + (4 \times 1) \\
&= 3 + 0 + 0 + 4 \\
&= 7
\end{align*}
$$

Next, calculate the magnitude of the vector for both Document 1 and Document 2:

Document 1's magnitude:
$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Magnitude} &= \sqrt{3^2 + 0^2 + 2^2 + 4^2} \\
&= \sqrt{9 + 0 + 4 + 16} \\
&= \sqrt{29} \\
\end{align*}
$$

Document 2's magnitude:
$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Magnitude} &= \sqrt{1^2 + 4^2 + 0^2 + 1^2} \\
&= \sqrt{1 + 16 + 0 + 1} \\
&= \sqrt{18} \\
\end{align*}
$$

Finally, we apply the cosine similarity formula:

$$
\text{Cosine Similarity} = \frac{\text{Dot Product}}{\text{Magnitude of Document 1} \times \text{Magnitude of Document 2}}
$$

Substitute the calculated values into the formula:

$$
\text{Cosine Similarity} = \frac{7}{\sqrt{29} \times \sqrt{18}} = \frac{7}{\sqrt{522}} \approx 0.3068
$$

Hence, the cosine similarity between Document 1 and Document 2 is approximately 0.31, which we round to the nearest given option, 0.33.

## Correct Answer

3. 0.33

## Reasoning

Cosine similarity is a measure used to calculate how similar two documents are irrespective of their size. Mathematically, it measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors projected in a multi-dimensional space. This process involves calculating the dot product of the vectors and dividing it by the product of their magnitudes. The closer the cosine value to 1, the smaller the angle and the higher the similarity. The calculation in this scenario is based on the term frequency counts of each document, which are treated as vectors in the arithmetic process. The steps involved calculating the dot product of the vectors representing each document, the magnitudes of these vectors, and then applying these values in the cosine similarity formula. The approximate value of 0.3068 rounded to the nearest provided option gives us 0.33, demonstrating an intermediate level of similarity between Document 1 and Document 2.
