## Question

A data scientist is tasked with extracting phone numbers from a large database of customer feedback text. The feedback contains a mix of international and local (US-based) phone numbers, and the goal is to format all phone numbers uniformly as international phone numbers (E.164 format). Given that the phone numbers in the text are in various formats (for example, "123.456.7890", "(123) 456 7890", "123-456-7890", "+1 123-456-7890"), which of the following regular expressions will most effectively help to identify and transform all these phone number formats into a standardized E.164 format without losing any information?

1. `\d{3}[\.-]\d{3}[\.-]\d{4}`
2. `\(\d{3}\)\s?\d{3}[-\s]?\d{4}`
3. `[+]?\d?\s?(\(\d{3}\)|\d{3})[\s.-]?\d{3}[\s.-]?\d{4}`
4. `(\+\d{1,2}\s?)?(\(\d{3}\)|\d{3})[\s.-]?\d{3}[\s.-]?\d{4}`
5. `(\+\d{1,2}\s?)?(\d{3}|\(\d{3}\))(\s|-|\.)?\d{3}(\s|-|\.)?\d{4}`

## Solution

To evaluate the best option, we need to understand the components of each regular expression and how they match the requirements:

1. This pattern `\d{3}[\.-]\d{3}[\.-]\d{4}` looks for three digits followed by a period or dash, then another three digits followed by a period or dash, and finally four digits. This would only match formats like "123-456-7890" or "123.456.7890" but wouldnâ€™t match formats with parentheses or spaces, nor accept an optional country code.

2. The pattern `\(\d{3}\)\s?\d{3}[-\s]?\d{4}` is specifically designed to match numbers in the format of "(123) 456-7890" with optional spaces. Like the first one, this pattern doesn't accommodate all variations or the optional country code.

3. `[+]?\d?\s?(\(\d{3}\)|\d{3})[\s.-]?\d{3}[\s.-]?\d{4}` attempts to match an optional plus sign for country code, followed by an optional single digit (which fails to correctly match longer country codes or even the US country code "+1" correctly), then either three digits or three digits inside parentheses, followed by optional spaces, dashes, or dots before the next sequences of digits. It improves upon the first two patterns by considering more variations but still incorrectly handles the optional country code.

4. `(\+\d{1,2}\s?)?(\(\d{3}\)|\d{3})[\s.-]?\d{3}[\s.-]?\d{4}` matches an optional country code of one or two digits prefixed with a plus (covering country codes more accurately), followed by either digits or digits within parentheses, with spaces, dots, or dashes as optional separators. This pattern is the most flexible and accurate so far for varying phone number formats and includes appropriate handling for international codes, making it suitable for standardization to E.164 format.

5. The last option, `(\+\d{1,2}\s?)?(\d{3}|\(\d{3}\))(\s|-|\.)?\d{3}(\s|-|\.)?\d{4}`, is quite similar to option 4 but rearranged slightly. Nevertheless, it offers no practical advantage over option 4 and essentially matches the same formats with similar flexibility.

Given these analyses, option 4 is the most effective regular expression for the given task. It captures a wide variety of phone number formats, including those with and without country codes, and accounts for different separators while being precise enough not to capture unintended text. This regex can serve as a basis for then transforming the matched numbers into a standard E.164 format.

## Correct Answer

4. `(\+\d{1,2}\s?)?(\(\d{3}\)|\d{3})[\s.-]?\d{3}[\s.-]?\d{4}`

## Reasoning

Option 4 is the best regular expression for this task as it is comprehensive enough to match all specified phone number formats in the question, including different separators (space, dash, and dot) and variations (with and without parentheses), as well as accounting for an optional international country code prefix. This makes it the most suitable choice for identifying the phone numbers from text and converting them into a uniform format without loss of information, which is crucial for the subsequent standardization to E.164 format. This regex demonstrates a complex understanding and application of regular expressions to solve a practical problem in text mining, aligning with the evaluation level of Bloom's Taxonomy by requiring students to judge the adequacy of different regular expression options for a real-world text processing task.
