## Question
A data scientist is working on a text mining project that involves analyzing customer feedback from an online e-commerce platform. The raw feedback data contains various non-alphanumeric characters such as punctuation marks, special symbols, and numbers that are deemed irrelevant for sentiment analysis. They decided to preprocess this textual data by removing these non-alphanumeric characters to simplify subsequent analysis. 

Which of the following regular expressions should the data scientist use in a Python environment to achieve this preprocessing step on a string variable `text`?

1. `re.sub(r'\W+', '', text)`
2. `re.sub(r'\w+', '', text)`
3. `re.sub(r'^\w+', '', text)`
4. `re.sub(r'[a-zA-Z]', '', text)`
5. `re.sub(r'[0-9]', '', text)`

## Solution

The correct answer is `re.sub(r'\W+', '', text)`.

### Reasoning

The task at hand is to remove non-alphanumeric characters from the textual data. This includes punctuation, special symbols, and any characters that are not part of the standard English alphabet (both uppercase and lowercase) or digits (0-9).

- Choice 1, `re.sub(r'\W+', '', text)`, uses the regular expression `\W+` which matches any sequence of characters that are not word characters. In regular expressions, a word character (`\w`) refers to any alphanumeric character (letters and digits) including underscore (_). Therefore, `\W` (uppercase) is the negation, matching any character that is not alphanumeric, which is exactly what needs to be removed. The `+` indicates one or more occurrences of non-word characters. This means the expression will match strings of characters that are not alphanumeric and replace them with an empty string, effectively removing them from `text`.

- Choice 2, `re.sub(r'\w+', '', text)`, is incorrect as it would remove all alphanumeric characters (opposite of our requirement), leaving behind non-alphanumeric characters.

- Choice 3, `re.sub(r'^\w+', '', text)`, is also incorrect. While it attempts to use `\w+` to target alphanumeric characters, the caret `^` symbol at the beginning means it would only match alphanumeric characters at the start of the string, not everywhere in the text.

- Choice 4, `re.sub(r'[a-zA-Z]', '', text)`, would remove all letters (both uppercase and lowercase) from the text but leave digits and non-alphanumeric characters, which is not fully aligned with the preprocessing goal.

- Choice 5, `re.sub(r'[0-9]', '', text)`, only targets digits for removal, leaving letters and non-alphanumeric characters intact, which again does not meet the requirement.

Therefore, the only option that accomplishes the goal of removing non-alphanumeric characters from the text entirely is Choice 1.

## Correct Answer

1. `re.sub(r'\W+', '', text)`
