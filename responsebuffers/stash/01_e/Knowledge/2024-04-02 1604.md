## Question
Imagine you are working on cleaning a dataset of customer reviews before feeding it into a sentiment analysis model. The dataset contains a mixture of languages, including English and French, but you want to process only the English-language text. You decide to use a simple heuristic to filter out non-English text: You will remove any reviews that contain characters not found in the English alphabet, including accented characters often found in French. Using Python's regular expressions (regex) module, `re`, which of the following code snippets correctly implements this filter?

1. `re.sub(r"[^a-zA-Z\s]", "", text)`
2. `re.sub(r"[a-zA-Z\s]", "", text)`
3. `re.findall(r"[a-zA-Z\s]+", text)`
4. `re.match(r"[^a-zA-Z\s]+", text)`
5. `re.sub(r"[^\x00-\x7F]+", "", text)`

## Solution

The correct answer is option 1.

To arrive at the correct answer, let's analyze each option:
- Option 1 uses `re.sub` with a pattern that matches any character that is not (`^` at the start of the character class) a lowercase letter (`a-z`), an uppercase letter (`A-Z`), or a whitespace character (`\s`). It then replaces these matched characters with an empty string `""`, effectively removing them. This process retains only the English alphabet and whitespace, aligning with the requirement to filter out reviews with non-English characters.
  
- Option 2 is incorrect because it does the opposite of what is needed. It matches and removes all lowercase and uppercase English letters and whitespace, leaving behind only the characters that were supposed to be removed.

- Option 3, `re.findall`, would collect all substrings matching the pattern (letters and spaces), but since it returns a list of matches rather than a single string, it does not directly achieve the goal of filtering the original text. Also, it does not remove the non-English characters but extracts sequences of English letters and spaces.

- Option 4 uses `re.match`, which only checks for a match at the beginning of the string. This would not work for filtering out non-English characters throughout the entire review text.

- Option 5 aims to remove non-ASCII characters by targeting characters outside the ASCII range (`\x00-\x7F`). Though this effectively removes non-English characters, it may also remove other characters valid in English text but not within the ASCII range, such as certain punctuation marks. This option could work but might be too broad for the specific task of filtering out only non-English alphabet characters.

## Correct Answer

1. `re.sub(r"[^a-zA-Z\s]", "", text)`

## Reasoning

The correct answer effectively processes the dataset by retaining only the characters that are part of the English alphabet (both lowercase and uppercase) and whitespace. This approach simplifies the text preprocessing step for sentiment analysis by ensuring that the input texts are in English, as per the heuristic defined. It applies knowledge of regular expressions to address a typical text preprocessing challenge in natural language processing tasks efficiently.
