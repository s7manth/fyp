## Problem Statement

You are tasked with designing a language model that can accurately predict the sentiment of a movie review. The model will be trained on a dataset of movie reviews, where each review is labeled with a sentiment score between -1 and 1.

## Choices

1. **Use a traditional bag-of-words (BoW) model:** Represent each review as a vector of word counts, and use a classifier to learn the relationship between word counts and sentiment scores.
2. **Embbed the words:** Convert each word into a numerical vector representation, and use a classifier to learn the relationship between vector representations and sentiment scores.
3. **Use word embedding techniques:** Generate word embeddings from the reviews, and use these embeddings to learn the relationship between embeddings and sentiment scores.
4. **Incorporate semantic features:** Include additional features in the model that capture semantic similarity between words, such as WordNet or Word2vec.
5. **Use a transformer-based model:** Utilize a transformer-based model, such as BERT, to learn the relationship between words and sentiment scores.

## Solution

The correct answer is 3.

**Reasoning:**

Word embeddings are a powerful technique for capturing semantic information about words. By learning word embeddings from the movie reviews, the model can capture the semantic relationships between words and use this information to predict sentiment scores. This approach is more effective than using a traditional BoW model or incorporating semantic features manually, as it allows the model to learn the relationships between words in a data-driven manner.
