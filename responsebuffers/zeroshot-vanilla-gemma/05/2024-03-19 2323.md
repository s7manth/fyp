## Problem Statement

A novel text summarization technique has been developed that utilizes vector embeddings and a similarity measure based on cosine. Given a text document, this technique generates a summary by identifying the most similar documents in a large corpus. Describe the key steps involved in this technique and explain how it achieves its desired outcome.

## Choices

1. The technique relies on word embeddings generated from a pre-trained language model.
2. The similarity measure utilizes Jaccard Index to find documents with similar content.
3. The method incorporates sentence embeddings generated using Word2vec.
4. The technique employs TF-IDF weighting to assign higher scores to documents containing more relevant terms.
5. The approach incorporates Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) to compute document similarity.

## Solution

**Key Steps:**

1. **Vector Embeddings:** Convert the text document into a vector representation using a pre-trained language model or other embedding techniques.
2. **Cosine Similarity:** Calculate the cosine similarity between the document vector and the vectors of all documents in the corpus.
3. **Ranking and Selection:** Rank the documents based on their cosine similarity scores. Select the top-k documents, where k is the desired length of the summary.
4. **Concatenation:** Concatenate the text content of the selected documents to create the summary.

**Reasoning:**

The technique utilizes vector embeddings to capture semantic similarity between documents, enabling a robust and efficient text summarization process. Cosine similarity is chosen as a suitable metric for measuring similarity due to its robustness to noise and its ability to handle high-dimensional vector spaces. The use of pre-trained language models or other embedding techniques allows for efficient vector representation learning. By ranking documents based on their similarity scores, the technique identifies documents most relevant to the input text, ultimately leading to a concise summary.
