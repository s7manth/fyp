## Problem Statement

A novel text summarization technique has been developed that utilizes vector embeddings and a novel similarity measure. This technique aims to generate concise summaries of documents while preserving their semantic meaning. The technique involves the following steps:

1. Text pre-processing: removing stop words, stemming words, etc.
2. Sentence embedding: converting sentences into vector representations.
3. Document embedding: combining sentence embeddings into a single vector representation for the document.
4. Similarity measure: finding documents that are most similar to a given document.
5. Summary generation: selecting the most similar documents and combining their content to generate a summary.

**Choices:**

1. The technique utilizes a Cosine Similarity measure to find documents that are most similar to a given document.
2. The technique incorporates a TF-IDF weighting scheme to account for the importance of different terms in the document.
3. The technique employs Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) to measure the similarity between sentences.
4. The technique utilizes Word2vec to learn semantic relationships between words.
5. The technique incorporates Bias and Embeddings principles to ensure fairness and mitigate bias in the summaries.

## Solution

**Reasoning:**

The correct answer is 2.

The text summarization technique utilizes a TF-IDF weighting scheme to account for the importance of different terms in the document. TF-IDF is a commonly used weighting scheme in text summarization techniques that assigns a higher weight to terms that occur more frequently in the document relative to other documents in the collection. This weighting scheme is effective in capturing the most relevant terms in a document and incorporating them into the summary.
