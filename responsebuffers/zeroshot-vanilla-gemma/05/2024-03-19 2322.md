## Problem Statement

A new language model is designed to capture the semantic relationships between words. Given a pair of words, the model outputs a score indicating their similarity. However, the model is biased, meaning that it does not treat all words equally.

## Choices

1. The model incorporates bias due to the presence of word embeddings.
2. The model incorporates bias due to the use of TF-IDF weighting.
3. The model incorporates bias due to the use of pointwise mutual information (PMI).
4. The model incorporates bias due to the use of cosine similarity.
5. The model incorporates bias due to the use of word2vec.

## Solution

The correct answer is 1.

**Reasoning:**

The model incorporates bias because of the presence of word embeddings. Word embeddings are learned representations of words that capture their semantic relationships. These embeddings are used in the model to calculate similarity between words. However, word embeddings can be biased, meaning that they do not treat all words equally. This bias is reflected in the model's output, which shows that the model does not treat all words equally.
