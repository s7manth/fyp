## Problem Statement

Natural language processing (NLP) has revolutionized various fields. One of the most significant advancements in NLP is the advent of transformer-based large language models (LLMs). These models have achieved state-of-the-art performance on various tasks, including text summarization, translation, and code generation.

**Choices:**

1. The primary benefit of transformers over traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) is their ability to process long sequences of text more efficiently.
2. LLMs are primarily trained on large text datasets and are capable of generating coherent text.
3. Multi-head attention is a key component of transformer-based LLMs that allows them to attend to different parts of the input sequence.
4. Transformer blocks are the building blocks of transformer-based LLMs and consist of self-attention layers and feed-forward networks.
5. The residual stream view of the transformer block is a simplified version of the transformer architecture that emphasizes the flow of information between layers.

## Solution

The correct answer is 2.

**Reasoning:**

LLMs are large language models that have been trained on massive amounts of text data and are capable of generating high-quality text. They have revolutionized various NLP tasks and achieved state-of-the-art performance. LLMs rely on transformer architectures, which are based on self-attention mechanisms. Multi-head attention is a key component of transformer-based LLMs that allows them to attend to different parts of the input sequence.
