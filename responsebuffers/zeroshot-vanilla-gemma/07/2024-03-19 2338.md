## Problem Statement

The Transformer architecture revolutionized natural language processing (NLP) by introducing self-attention mechanisms and drastically improving performance on various tasks. Explain the key idea behind the residual stream view of the transformer block and its significance in the transformer architecture.

## Choices

1. The residual stream view replaces the original input with the residual output.
2. The residual stream view adds the original input to the residual output.
3. The residual stream view incorporates the original input and the residual output.
4. The residual stream view utilizes the original input and the scaled residual output.
5. The residual stream view incorporates the original input and the scaled residual output.

## Solution

The residual stream view is a key concept in the transformer block architecture. It introduces a new way to process the input by adding the residual output from the previous layer to the original input. This process is repeated for each layer in the transformer block, allowing the model to learn more complex representations of the input.

The residual stream view is significant because it allows the transformer block to capture long-range dependencies between tokens in the input sequence more effectively. By adding the residual output to the original input, the model can learn from the previous layers and make more informed decisions about the current token.

## Reasoning

The correct answer is 3. The residual stream view incorporates the original input and the residual output. This is because the residual stream view adds the original input and the residual output from the previous layer to the input of the current layer, allowing the model to learn from the previous layers and make more informed decisions about the current token.
