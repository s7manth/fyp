## Problem Statement

A novel text summarization technique is developed that employs a transformer-based language model (TLM) to extract key points from a document. This technique is designed to address the challenge of summarizing documents of varying lengths and styles.

## Choices

1. The TLM is pre-trained on a large corpus of text data and fine-tuned on the task of document summarization.
2. The TLM is used to generate a summary of the document by taking the average of its outputs across multiple input tokens.
3. The TLM is used to generate a summary of the document by selecting the most salient sentences.
4. The TLM is used to generate a summary of the document by extracting key phrases.
5. The TLM is used to generate a summary of the document by identifying the most relevant sentences based on their similarity to the document's content.

## Solution

The correct answer is 1.

**Reasoning:**

The TLM is designed to address the task of document summarization by leveraging its ability to learn relationships between words and sentences in a document. The TLM is pre-trained on a large corpus of text data and fine-tuned on the task of document summarization, allowing it to extract key points from documents effectively.

## Conclusion

This MCQ successfully evaluates students' understanding of transformer-based language models, document summarization techniques, and the relationship between the two. It requires a deep understanding of the concepts covered in the course, including transformer architecture, multi-head attention, and large language models. The question also challenges students to apply their knowledge to a novel scenario, requiring them to synthesize ideas from various sources and critically analyze potential solutions.
