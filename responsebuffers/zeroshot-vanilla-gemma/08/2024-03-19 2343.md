## Problem Statement

A large language model (LLM) is tasked with the problem of generating high-quality summaries of scientific papers. This LLM is trained on a massive dataset of scientific papers and is able to generate summaries of various papers with high accuracy. However, the LLM struggles to generate summaries for papers that are highly technical in nature, particularly those dealing with complex mathematical concepts.

## Choices

1. The LLM lacks the ability to handle complex mathematical concepts.
2. The LLM is not able to access the full context of the paper, leading to inaccurate summaries.
3. The LLM is biased towards papers with simpler language structures.
4. The LLM is unable to generate summaries that are concise and informative.
5. The LLM does not have the capacity to generate summaries that are tailored to the specific audience.

## Solution

The correct answer is 2.

**Reasoning:**

The LLM is trained on a vast dataset of scientific papers, but it does not have the ability to access the full context of a paper, particularly its technical details. This limitation is evident in the LLM's struggles with papers that involve complex mathematical concepts. Without access to the full context, the LLM cannot generate accurate summaries for these papers.
