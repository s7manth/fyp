## Problem Statement

A new language model, dubbed "LangMaster," has been developed that incorporates the latest advancements in natural language processing (NLP). This model is designed to be highly versatile and able to tackle a wide range of tasks related to language understanding and generation. However, there are some aspects of LangMaster's functionality that remain unclear.

## Choices

1. LangMaster utilizes a transformer-based architecture, incorporating both self-attention and masked language modeling techniques.
2. LangMaster relies on a traditional recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture, capable of handling long sequences of text.
3. LangMaster employs a context-sensitive embedding approach, where the model learns representations of words based on their relationships with other words in the sentence.
4. LangMaster incorporates a fine-tuning procedure to optimize its performance on specific tasks.
5. LangMaster utilizes a span-based masking technique to handle complex sentence structures and syntax.

## Solution

The correct answer is 1.

**Reasoning:**

LangMaster's use of transformer-based architecture, self-attention, and masked language modeling techniques is consistent with the latest advancements in NLP. The use of these techniques allows LangMaster to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of tasks, including language translation, text summarization, and question answering.
