## Problem Statement

A new language model, dubbed "Lingo-XL," has been developed that boasts state-of-the-art performance on various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, researchers have noticed a peculiar phenomenon with Lingo-XL: its performance on certain tasks declines when the model is fine-tuned on a different dataset than the one it was initially trained on.

## Choices

1. The model's architecture is not flexible enough to accommodate different datasets.
2. The model's parameters are not optimized for transfer learning.
3. The model's training process is biased towards the original dataset.
4. The model's capacity for generalization is limited due to overfitting.
5. The model's pre-training process is inadequate for fine-tuning on new datasets.

## Solution

Lingo-XL exhibits poor transfer learning capabilities due to its limited capacity for generalization. Fine-tuning a language model on a dataset different from the one it was trained on often leads to overfitting, which results in poor performance on unseen data.

## Reasoning

The correct answer is choice 4. The model's overfitting on the new dataset is the primary cause of its decline in performance. The other choices are not relevant to the problem statement.
