## Problem Statement

A novel text summarization technique utilizes a pre-trained transformer-based language model (TLM) and a novel masking strategy known as "span-based masking." This technique achieves state-of-the-art performance on text summarization tasks.

**Choices:**

1. The technique utilizes a transformer-based language model and a novel masking strategy known as "span-based masking."
2. The technique relies on fine-tuning the pre-trained TLM on the specific task of text summarization.
3. The technique employs a bidirectional transformer encoder to capture context from the input text.
4. The technique utilizes contextual embeddings to represent the input text in a high-dimensional vector space.
5. The technique employs a novel training method for Bidirectional Transformer Encoders.

## Solution

The correct answer is 1.

**Reasoning:**

The text summarization technique utilizes a pre-trained transformer-based language model and a novel masking strategy known as "span-based masking." Span-based masking involves masking a subset of the input text with special tokens, allowing the model to focus on the remaining portions of the text and learn the key concepts. This technique has been shown to be effective for text summarization tasks, as it allows the model to capture long-range dependencies and contextual information from the input text.
