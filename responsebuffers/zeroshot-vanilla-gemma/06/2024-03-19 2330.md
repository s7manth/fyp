## Problem Statement

A novel language model has been developed that utilizes feed-forward neural networks for sentiment analysis. The model is able to accurately classify text samples into positive or negative sentiment categories. However, the model's performance is not optimal, and there are several potential areas for improvement.

## Choices

1. The model's architecture is not well-suited for sentiment analysis tasks.
2. The model is not able to learn complex relationships between words.
3. The model is biased towards positive sentiment.
4. The model does not have sufficient training data.
5. The model's parameters are not optimized for sentiment analysis.

## Solution

The correct answer is 5.

**Reasoning:**

The model's performance issues are likely due to the model's parameters not being optimized for sentiment analysis. This is because sentiment analysis is a complex task that requires the model to learn a wide range of relationships between words and concepts. If the model's parameters are not optimized for sentiment analysis, it will not be able to learn these relationships effectively.

To improve the model's performance, the model's parameters would need to be optimized for sentiment analysis. This could be done using a variety of techniques, such as gradient descent or Bayesian optimization. Once the parameters have been optimized, the model should be able to more accurately classify text samples into positive or negative sentiment categories.
