## Problem Statement

A novel language model has been developed that utilizes feed-forward neural networks for language modeling. This model is designed to predict the next word in a sequence given a context of the previous words. However, the model is experiencing some difficulties with a specific task - sentence completion.

## Choices

1. The model is not able to handle the complexity of sentence structure.
2. The model is unable to learn the relationships between words.
3. The model is not able to generalize well to unseen data.
4. The model is unable to capture the semantic meaning of words.
5. The model is not able to handle the task of sentence completion effectively.

## Solution

The correct answer is 5.

**Reasoning:**

The model's difficulty with sentence completion is due to its inability to capture the semantic meaning of words and generalize well to unseen data. In order to complete a sentence, a model must be able to understand the relationships between words and the overall meaning of the sentence. If the model is unable to capture these factors, it will not be able to complete sentences accurately.

## Training the neural language model

In order to improve the model's performance on sentence completion, several steps could be taken. First, the model could be trained on a larger dataset of text data. This would help the model to learn the relationships between words more effectively. Second, the model could be equipped with additional features that allow it to capture the semantic meaning of words. Third, the model could be trained using a technique called transfer learning, which would allow it to generalize better to unseen data.
