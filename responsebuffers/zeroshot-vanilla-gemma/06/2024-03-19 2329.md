## Problem Statement

The advent of deep learning revolutionized the field of natural language processing (NLP). One of the most impactful deep learning techniques in NLP is feed-forward neural networks (FFNNs). In the context of NLP, FFNNs have been successfully applied to various tasks, including text classification and language modeling.

## Choices

1. **The XOR problem is a fundamental challenge faced by neural networks when learning binary relationships.**
2. **Feed-forward neural networks are not well-suited for handling sequential data.**
3. **Infeed-forward neural networks for NLP, the output layer typically consists of a softmax function.**
4. **Training a neural language model involves optimizing the model's weights using gradient descent.**
5. **The main advantage of using feed-forward neural networks for NLP is their ability to learn complex patterns from data.**

## Solution

The correct answer is 4.

**Reasoning:**

Feed-forward neural networks are a type of neural network that process information through a series of interconnected layers. In NLP, feed-forward neural networks are commonly used for tasks such as text classification and language modeling. To train a neural language model, the model's weights are optimized using gradient descent, which involves iteratively adjusting the weights to minimize the error between the model's predictions and the actual labels.

## Reasoning

This question requires a synthesis of ideas from various topics covered in the course, including neural networks, feed-forward neural networks, and training neural networks. It also incorporates practical applications of these concepts to the task of training a neural language model. The question is designed to challenge students to apply their knowledge in novel and complex scenarios, rather than relying on rote memorization or simple recall.
