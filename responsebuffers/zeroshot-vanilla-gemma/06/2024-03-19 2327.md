## Problem Statement

A novel text summarization technique has been developed that leverages deep learning to extract key sentences from a document. The model utilizes a feed-forward neural network with an attention mechanism to identify the most important sentences. However, the model's performance is sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters, particularly the learning rate and the number of layers.

## Choices

1. The model is unable to extract any key sentences from the document.
2. The model can extract key sentences, but the extracted sentences are not necessarily related to the document content.
3. The model can extract key sentences that are highly relevant to the document content.
4. The model can extract key sentences, but the extracted sentences are too short.
5. The model can extract key sentences, but the extracted sentences are too long.

## Solution

The correct answer is 3.

**Reasoning:**

The attention mechanism in the neural network allows the model to focus on the most relevant parts of the document. The number of layers and the learning rate influence the model's ability to learn complex relationships between words and sentences. By carefully tuning these hyperparameters, the model can extract key sentences that are highly relevant to the document content.

## Conclusion

This problem requires a deep understanding of the concepts covered in the course on neural networks and natural language processing. It also challenges students to apply their knowledge to a novel and complex scenario. The solution involves a unique synthesis of ideas from various topics, including neural networks, text summarization, and attention mechanisms.
