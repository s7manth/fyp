## Problem Statement

A new language model has been developed that utilizes feed-forward neural networks for sentiment analysis. This model is able to analyze text and determine whether the text expresses positive or negative sentiment. However, the model is not able to handle some complex linguistic constructs, such as sarcasm or irony. To improve the model's performance, various modifications can be made.

## Choices

1. The model should be modified to include a layer for handling syntactic structure.
2. The model should be trained on a larger dataset of text data.
3. The model should be fine-tuned using transfer learning.
4. The model should be modified to incorporate attention mechanisms.
5. The model should be redesigned to use a different type of neural network architecture.

## Solution

The correct answer is 4.

**Reasoning:**

Sarcasm and irony are two linguistic constructs that are difficult for neural networks to learn. Attention mechanisms have been shown to be effective in handling these constructs. By incorporating attention mechanisms into the model, it is possible to improve its performance on sentiment analysis tasks.

## Reasoning

The thought process for arriving at this answer was as follows:

- The model is not able to handle complex linguistic constructs, such as sarcasm or irony.
- Attention mechanisms have been shown to be effective in handling these constructs.
- Therefore, the model should be modified to incorporate attention mechanisms.
