## Problem Statement

A large language model is tasked with the job of analyzing a document containing a conversation between two people. The goal is to identify the speaker of each sentence in the document. However, the text provided contains some irregularities and noise, such as misspellings, punctuation errors, and irrelevant text.

## Choices

1. The model can accurately identify the speaker of each sentence by applying standard text normalization techniques.
2. The model must first segment the text into sentences before identifying the speaker of each sentence.
3. The model can identify the speaker of each sentence by using a lexicon of common words associated with each speaker.
4. The model can identify the speaker of each sentence by using a combination of text normalization techniques and sentence segmentation.
5. The model can identify the speaker of each sentence by using a combination of text normalization techniques, sentence segmentation, and word tokenization.

## Solution

The correct answer is 5.

**Reasoning:**

The text normalization techniques, sentence segmentation, and word tokenization are all necessary to preprocess the text before identifying the speaker of each sentence. By applying these techniques, the model can remove the irregularities and noise from the text, making it easier to identify the speaker of each sentence.
