## Problem Statement

A new language model has been developed that can understand and generate human-like text. However, there is a bug in the model that affects its ability to handle certain types of text, such as noisy text or text that contains grammatical errors. To fix the bug, the model needs to be improved.

## Choices

1. The model needs to be retrained on a larger dataset of text.
2. The model needs to be re-engineered to handle noisy text.
3. The model needs to be modified to handle text with grammatical errors.
4. The model needs to be improved to handle text that contains slang words.
5. The model needs to be improved to handle text that contains misspellings.

## Solution

The correct answer is 3.

**Reasoning:**

The bug in the model is related to its inability to handle text with grammatical errors. To fix this bug, the model needs to be modified to handle text with grammatical errors. This is because the model is not able to understand the meaning of words that are not properly spelled or grammatically incorrect.
