## Problem Statement

A large language model has been trained on a massive dataset of text documents. The model is designed to understand and generate human-like text. However, it has been noticed that the model sometimes makes errors when processing text, particularly with words that are similar to each other.

## Choices

1. The model is not able to handle homographs (words that look like different words but have the same meaning).
2. The model is not able to handle synonyms (words that have similar meanings).
3. The model is not able to handle polysemy (words that have multiple meanings).
4. The model is not able to handle compound words (words that are made up of smaller words).
5. The model is not able to handle words that are spelled incorrectly.

## Solution

The correct answer is 3.

## Reasoning

The model's errors are primarily caused by polysemy. Polysemy is a phenomenon where a single word has multiple meanings. This can be seen in the model's mistakes, where it sometimes misinterprets the meaning of a word based on its other meanings.
