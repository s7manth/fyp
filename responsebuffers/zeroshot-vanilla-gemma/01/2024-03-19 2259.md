## Problem Statement

A new language model is designed to understand the meaning of sentences written in plain text. However, the model struggles with sentences containing grammatical errors and typos. To improve the model's performance, several techniques can be employed.

## Choices

1. **Lemmatization:** Converting words to their root form (e.g., "running" -> "run").
2. **Stemming:** Reducing words to their stems (e.g., "running" -> "run").
3. **Word Normalization:** Removing noise and inconsistencies from text (e.g., converting all lowercase to uppercase).
4. **Word Tokenization:** Splitting text into sentences or words based on a specific criteria.
5. **Sentence Segmentation:** Dividing text into sentences based on grammatical boundaries.

## Solution

The answer is 2. Stemming.

**Reasoning:**

Lemmatization and stemming are both techniques used to normalize text and reduce word ambiguity. While lemmatization is more accurate, it is also more computationally expensive. Stemming, on the other hand, is faster and easier to implement. In this specific scenario, stemming is more appropriate as the model is designed to understand the meaning of sentences, rather than identify the exact word meaning.
