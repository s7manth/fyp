## Problem Statement

A new text summarization tool has been developed that utilizes a deep learning approach to generate concise summaries of documents. However, the tool is experiencing issues with its performance on certain documents, and researchers are investigating the causes of these problems.

## Choices

1. The model is not able to learn the relationships between words in the document.
2. The model is not able to capture the semantic meaning of the document.
3. The model is not able to handle documents with complex sentence structure.
4. The model is not able to generate summaries that are concise enough.
5. The model is not able to handle documents that are too short.

## Solution

The correct answer is 2.

**Reasoning:**

The sigmoid function, which is used in logistic regression, is able to capture the linear relationship between the input features and the output label. However, it is not able to capture the semantic meaning of the document. In order to capture the semantic meaning of the document, a more sophisticated model, such as a transformer-based model, would be required.
