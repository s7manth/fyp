## Problem Statement

A new language model is developed that can predict the sentiment of a movie review. The model is trained on a dataset of movie reviews and assigns a sentiment score between 1 and 5 for each review. However, the model is not perfect and sometimes makes incorrect predictions.

## Choices

1. The model is suffering from overfitting.
2. The model is not able to capture the nuances of language.
3. The model is not able to handle imbalanced datasets.
4. The model is not able to generalize well to unseen data.
5. The model is not able to handle noisy data.

## Solution

The correct answer is 4.

The model is not able to generalize well to unseen data. This is because the model is not able to capture the nuances of language and therefore cannot generalize well to unseen data.

## Reasoning

The model is able to capture the sentiment of a movie review by learning the relationships between words and their corresponding sentiment scores. However, the model is not able to generalize well to unseen data because it is not able to capture the nuances of language. This is because the model is not able to handle noisy data and imbalanced datasets.
