## Problem Statement

A large language model (LLM) is trained on a massive dataset of text, but it exhibits a peculiar behavior: it often generates sentences that are highly similar to the training data, even when presented with novel inputs. This phenomenon is known as ________.

## Choices

1. **Overfitting:** The model simply memorizes the training data, without learning general patterns.
2. **Underfitting:** The model is unable to capture any patterns from the training data.
3. **Sampling:** The model randomly generates sentences from the training data.
4. **Noisiness:** The model introduces random noise into the generated sentences.
5. **Generalization:** The model can generalize well to unseen data, despite its similarity to the training data.

## Solution

The answer is 1.

**Reasoning:**

Overfitting occurs when a model learns too much from the training data and fails to generalize well to unseen data. In this case, the LLM is overfitting, as it generates sentences that are highly similar to the training data, even when presented with novel inputs.

**Thought process:**

- The concept of overfitting was introduced in the course lectures.
- The training and test sets are key concepts in evaluating language models.
- Perplexity is a measure of language model performance that is related to entropy.
- Sampling sentences from a language model is a common task.
- Generalization and zeros are concepts related to overfitting and underfitting.
- Smoothing techniques can help to reduce overfitting.
