## Problem Statement

A new online platform aims to personalize learning experiences based on individual reading habits. To classify the sentiment of user-generated text, the platform utilizes a Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC) trained on a large dataset of labeled text. However, the platform encounters issues with the performance of the NBC model, and several potential solutions are being considered.

## Choices

1. **Increase the number of training examples:** This would help the model learn more nuanced relationships between words and their sentiment.
2. **Use a different feature extraction method:** This could extract more relevant features from the text, improving the model's accuracy.
3. **Adjust the smoothing parameter:** Smoothing can help the model generalize better to unseen data, but it can also introduce bias.
4. **Implement a different classification algorithm:** Alternative algorithms, such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs), might be more effective in this specific task.
5. **Use domain-specific language models:** These models are trained on data specific to the domain of text sentiment analysis, which could improve the model's performance.

## Solution

The correct answer is 2.

**Reasoning:**

While increasing the number of training examples and adjusting the smoothing parameter could potentially improve the model's performance, these solutions are more likely to have limited impact compared to using a different feature extraction method. Domain-specific language models are designed specifically for sentiment analysis tasks and can capture complex semantic relationships between words, making them more effective for this particular scenario.

**Additional Notes:**

This question incorporates concepts related to Naive Bayes Classifiers, feature extraction, smoothing, classification algorithms, domain-specific language models, and evaluation metrics like precision and recall. It also requires students to consider various factors and weigh their potential impact on the model's performance, making it a challenging problem that necessitates a deep understanding of the course material.
