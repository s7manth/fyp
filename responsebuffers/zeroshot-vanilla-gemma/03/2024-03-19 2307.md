## Problem Statement

A new social media platform has gained significant popularity due to its unique focus on fostering meaningful interactions between users. The platform utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze user-generated content and facilitate personalized recommendations. However, the platform's developers are facing a challenge: accurately classifying the sentiment of user reviews and comments.

## Choices

1. The platform uses a rule-based approach to classify sentiment, where rules are manually defined based on linguistic features such as word frequency and word order.
2. The platform employs a lexicon-based approach, where sentiment scores are assigned to words based on their emotional connotations.
3. The platform utilizes a machine learning approach, specifically a Naive Bayes Classifier, to classify sentiment based on the probability of a document belonging to a particular sentiment class.
4. The platform employs a deep learning approach, using convolutional neural networks to extract features from user-generated content and classify sentiment.
5. The platform utilizes a hybrid approach, combining multiple NLP techniques to achieve the highest accuracy in sentiment classification.

## Solution

The correct answer is 3.

**Reasoning:**

The platform's use of a Naive Bayes Classifier for sentiment classification aligns with the course's coverage of NLP techniques for text classification. Naive Bayes Classifiers are well-suited for sentiment analysis due to their ability to handle large and noisy datasets, their robustness to noise and domain-specific language, and their effectiveness in capturing semantic relationships between words.

In order to classify sentiment accurately, the platform must consider the probability of a document belonging to a particular sentiment class. This is achieved by training the Naive Bayes Classifier on a large corpus of labeled text data. The training process involves identifying features that are most informative for sentiment classification and weighting them appropriately.

Therefore, the use of a Naive Bayes Classifier for sentiment classification on this platform is a well-informed choice that leverages the concepts and techniques covered in the course.
