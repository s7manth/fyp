## Problem Statement

A new online platform aims to personalize learning experiences based on students' reading habits. The platform analyzes text passages and assigns them to different learning groups based on their similarity. To optimize the grouping process, the platform needs to classify text passages into different categories.

## Choices

1. The platform should use a traditional rule-based system to categorize text passages.
2. The platform should utilize a deep learning model to classify text passages.
3. The platform should employ a Bayesian classifier to categorize text passages.
4. The platform should use a support vector machine to classify text passages.
5. The platform should use a combination of different classification techniques to categorize text passages.

## Solution

The correct answer is 3.

**Reasoning:**

The text describes a scenario where text passages need to be classified into different categories based on their similarity. Naive Bayes Classifiers are well-suited for this task due to their ability to handle large amounts of text data and their robustness to noise and irrelevant features.

To categorize text passages, the platform would need to:

1. **Tokenize** the text passages into words and sentences.
2. **Create a feature vector** for each text passage, which would represent the semantic and syntactic characteristics of the passage.
3. **Train a Naive Bayes Classifier** using the feature vectors as input and the desired category labels as output.
4. **Use the trained classifier** to classify new text passages into the appropriate categories.

## Evaluation

The question requires students to apply their knowledge of Naive Bayes Classifiers, text processing, and feature engineering to a real-world problem. It also requires them to understand the concepts of tokenization, feature vectors, and classification metrics such as precision, recall, and F-measure. The question is designed to challenge students to think critically and solve problems in a complex and multifaceted manner.
