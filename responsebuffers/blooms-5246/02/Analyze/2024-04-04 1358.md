## Question
A research team is working on enhancing a natural language processing (NLP) model focused on understanding complex sentences in legal documents. They need to implement a parsing strategy that helps in identifying the relationships between "agents" and "actions" within sentences, especially when dealing with passive constructions often found in these documents. Moreover, the model should also be capable of recognizing hierarchical structures to clarify subjects, objects, and the subtleties of nesting clauses. Based on this scenario, which of the following parsing techniques would best serve their requirements?

1. Constituency parsing only.
2. Dependency parsing only.
3. A combination of constituency parsing and word semantics analysis using WordNet.
4. A combination of dependency parsing and constituency parsing.
5. Implementing word semantics analysis with WordNet solely.

## Solution
The correct solution involves analyzing the specific needs mentioned in the scenario: identifying relationships between "agents" and "actions" (which is best handled by dependency parsing as it links words based on their roles and dependencies in a sentence), and recognizing hierarchical structures including subjects, objects, and nesting clauses (which is a strength of constituency parsing as it breaks down a text into sub-phrases or constituents).

1. Constituency parsing would be beneficial for understanding the hierarchical structure of sentences but may not efficiently clarify the specific agent-action relationships in passive constructions common in legal documents.
   
2. Dependency parsing excels at identifying relationships between words, such as between agents and actions, making it valuable for analyzing sentence structures in legal documents. However, it might not provide enough information on its own about the hierarchical structure of nested clauses.

3. Combining constituency parsing with word semantics analysis (WordNet) could offer insights into the meanings of words and hierarchical sentence structures but might not directly address the identification of agent-action relations in the context of passive and complex sentences.

4. A combination of dependency parsing and constituency parsing would address both the identification of relationships between agents and actions through dependency parsing and the hierarchical structure of sentences through constituency parsing. This dual approach would likely provide the comprehensive analysis capability needed for the complex sentence structures found in legal documents.

5. Implementing word semantics analysis with WordNet alone would enhance the model's understanding of word meanings and relationships but would not directly aid in parsing sentence structures or identifying agent-action relationships.

## Correct Answer
4. A combination of dependency parsing and constituency parsing.

## Reasoning
The research team's requirements point towards a need for both understanding relationships within sentences and clarifying hierarchical structures, making a combined approach most suitable. Dependency parsing directly addresses the requirement to identify relationships between agents and actions, particularly useful for passive sentences where the agent is not the subject. Constituency parsing complements this by breaking down sentences into their sub-phases or constituents, helping to clarify subjects, objects, and nested clauses' relationships. This combination offers a comprehensive solution for analyzing complex sentence structures in legal documents, where both the clarity of hierarchical sentence components and the specifics of agent-action relationships are crucial for accurate interpretation and understanding.
