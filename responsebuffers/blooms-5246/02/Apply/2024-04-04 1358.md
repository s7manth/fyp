## Question

Given the sentence "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog," you are instructed to apply your knowledge of dependency parsing to identify the type of grammatical relationship between "fox" and "jumps". Which of the following best describes this relationship?

1. amod (adjectival modifier)
2. nsubj (nominal subject)
3. advmod (adverbial modifier)
4. dobj (direct object)
5. det (determiner)

## Solution

To correctly identify the type of grammatical relationship between "fox" and "jumps" in the sentence "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog," we need to apply our understanding of dependency parsing principles.

**Dependency Parsing** is a method used in natural language processing to determine the structure of a sentence by establishing relationships between "head" words and words which modify those heads.

- **amod (adjectival modifier)** describes a relationship where an adjective modifies a noun. This doesn’t fit because "jumps" is not modifying "fox" in an adjectival manner.
- **nsubj (nominal subject)** indicates that a noun is the subject of a verb, which seems to fit our scenario because "fox" is indeed the subject performing the action of "jumps."
- **advmod (adverbial modifier)** defines a relationship where an adverb modifies a verb, an adjective, or another adverb, which is not applicable here as "fox" is neither an adverb nor acting as one.
- **dobj (direct object)** signifies that a noun is directly receiving the action of a verb, which doesn’t fit since "fox" is performing the action, not receiving it.
- **det (determiner)** refers to a modifying word that determines the kind of reference a noun or noun group has, such as "the," "a," "an," etc., which is also not the relationship between "fox" and "jumps."

Therefore, the correct answer is **nsubj (nominal subject)** as it best describes the grammatical relationship between "fox" (the noun performing the action) and "jumps" (the verb that the action is related to).

## Correct Answer

2. nsubj (nominal subject)

## Reasoning

In dependency parsing, identifying the type of grammatical relationships between words in a sentence is crucial. The relationship between "fox" and "jumps" is that of a subject performing an action, which is precisely what **nsubst (nominal subject)** represents in dependency parsing terminology. The nominal subject is the noun that is the actor of the verb, making it the correct choice in this context. This question applies theoretical knowledge of dependency parsing to a practical example, requiring students to understand how different types of word relationships are classified in dependency grammar.
