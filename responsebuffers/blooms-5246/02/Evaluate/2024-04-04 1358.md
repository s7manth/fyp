## Question
In analyzing a large corpus of English text for semantic meaning and syntactic structure to support a machine learning application focused on natural language understanding (NLU), you must decide on the most effective combination of text mining techniques to employ. Given the need to understand both the relational structure between words in sentences and the nuanced meanings of those words, which of the following combinations would you evaluate as the most effective?

1. Dependency Parsing and Word Semantics with WordNet
2. Constituency Parsing and N-grams
3. Sentence Structure analysis with Regular Expressions and Dependency Parsing
4. Dependency Parsing and Constituency Parsing
5. Word Semantics with WordNet and N-grams

## Solution

To arrive at the correct answer, we need to evaluate the effectiveness of each proposed combination in capturing both syntactic structures and semantic meanings within text data, which are crucial for enhancing natural language understanding (NLU) tasks.

1. **Dependency Parsing** is a technique used to analyze the grammatical structure of a sentence by establishing relationships between "head" words and words which modify those heads. This allows us to understand the relational structure between words in sentences, which contributes to syntactic understanding. **Word Semantics with WordNet** involves using the WordNet database to understand and analyze the meanings of words, including synonyms, antonyms, and various senses of a word, contributing to semantic understanding. Combining these techniques addresses both the relational structure and nuanced meanings, making it a strong candidate.

2. **Constituency Parsing** is used to analyze the sentence structure by breaking a sentence down into its constituent parts (e.g., noun phrases, verb phrases), which is useful for syntactic understanding. **N-grams** are contiguous sequences of n-items from a given text/speech, which can be used for predicting the next item in a sequence, but are less effective in deep semantic understanding beyond immediate context.

3. **Sentence Structure analysis with Regular Expressions** can be used to identify certain syntactic patterns in text, and **Dependency Parsing** as mentioned before, is great for understanding the grammatical structure. However, this combination leans more towards syntax with limited direct focus on semantics.

4. **Combining Dependency Parsing with Constituency Parsing** offers two syntactic analysis techniques, which might provide a very detailed structural analysis but lacks a direct approach to deep semantic analysis.

5. **Word Semantics with WordNet** as explained, excels in semantic analysis but combining it with **N-grams** focuses on contextual word usage which lacks the structural depth provided by parsing techniques needed for comprehensive NLU tasks.

Considering the need for both syntactic structure and semantic meaning for enhancing NLU, the combination of **Dependency Parsing and Word Semantics with WordNet** (option 1) would therefore be evaluated as the most effective.

## Correct Answer
1. Dependency Parsing and Word Semantics with WordNet

## Reasoning
The reason for this choice is twofold:
- **Dependency Parsing** offers a method to understand the relational structure between words in sentences, which is essential for syntactic analysis. It helps in identifying how different words in a sentence depend on each other, thereby laying out the syntactic structure.
- **Word Semantics with WordNet** provides a robust approach to understanding the meaning of words, including their various senses, relationships to other words (synonyms, antonyms, etc.), which is vital for semantic analysis. This is crucial for understanding not just the structure of language but its nuanced meanings and contexts.

This combination thus effectively covers both the essential aspects of syntactic and semantic analysis necessary for improving natural language understanding in machine learning applications, making it the most effective choice among the given options.
