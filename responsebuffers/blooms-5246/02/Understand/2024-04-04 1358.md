## Question

Given the sentence "The chef who cooked the meal was praised by the critic," and focusing on understanding sentence structure and its implications for text analysis, which parsing strategy would best enable a text mining application to identify the relationship between "chef" and "praise" in the context of this sentence?

1. Constituency parsing, focusing on noun phrases (NPs) and verb phrases (VPs).
2. Dependency parsing, establishing direct relations between "chef" and "praised."
3. A simple lexicon lookup for synonyms of "chef" and "praise."
4. Using WordNet to find semantic relations between "chef" and "praise."
5. Applying n-gram models to predict the likelihood of "chef" being related to "praise."

## Solution

To correctly approach this question, we must understand the difference between the parsing strategies and other text mining tools provided in the options. The sentence presents a passive structure where the action (praised) affects the subject (chef), indicating the relationship between “chef” and “praise.” The task involves identifying which method best reveals the underlying grammatical relationship.

1. **Constituency Parsing**: This strategy breaks down sentences into their grammatical components, like noun phrases (NPs) and verb phrases (VPs). While useful for identifying sentence structure, it may not directly highlight the semantic relationship between “chef” and “praise.”

2. **Dependency Parsing**: Dependency parsing directly connects words based on their syntactic dependencies. This method identifies how words in a sentence rely on each other, which is ideal for revealing the direct relationship (agent-patient or subject-action) between “chef” and “praised” despite the passive sentence construction.

3. **Simple Lexicon Lookup**: Looking up synonyms of “chef” and “praise” might provide semantic similarity or relatedness but fails to establish the syntactic or functional relationship within the given sentence.

4. **Using WordNet**: Similar to lexicon lookup, WordNet would provide information on the semantic field of both terms but wouldn’t necessarily reveal how they are connected in the context of this sentence, focusing more on meaning than syntactic structure.

5. **Applying N-Gram Models**: N-grams predict the occurrence or co-occurrence probabilities of sequences of words. Though useful for understanding word association and prediction in language models, n-grams do not inherently analyze or reveal grammatical dependencies or specific relationships in a sentence.

Considering these points, the method that best enables identifying the relationship between “chef” and “praise” in the given sentence, taking into account the need to understand the grammatical and functional dependencies in the sentence, is **Dependency Parsing**.

## Correct Answer

2. Dependency parsing, establishing direct relations between "chef" and "praised."

## Reasoning

Dependency parsing is best suited for this task because it establishes direct syntactic relationships between words, focusing on how they depend on each other within a sentence. This parsing technique will identify that “chef” is the subject being acted upon by the passive action “praised,” effectively mapping out the relationship between the two within the context. Unlike constituency parsing, which also highlights sentence structure but not in a way that directly connects action to actor (especially in passive voice), dependency parsing explicitly denotes these relations, thus facilitating an understanding of how "chef" is related to "praise" within the given context.
