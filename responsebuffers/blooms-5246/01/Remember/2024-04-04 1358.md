## Question
In the context of text preprocessing for text mining and natural language processing (NLP), which of the following regular expressions will successfully identify all email addresses in a string, assuming that the email addresses are standard with alphanumeric characters that might include periods and dashes, followed by an @ symbol, then more alphanumeric characters with possible periods or dashes, and finally a period followed by 2-4 alphabetical characters for the domain name?

1. `"[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,4}"`
2. `"[a-zA-Z]+@[a-zA-Z]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,4}"`
3. `"\w+@\w+\.\w{2,4}"`
4. `"[\w.-]+@\w+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,4}"`
5. `"[a-zA-Z0-9_]+@[a-zA-Z]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,4}"`

## Solution
To find the correct answer, let's analyze the components of each option related to the structure of a standard email address, based on the given question:

- Alphanumeric characters include letters (a-z, A-Z) and digits (0-9).
- Periods (.) and dashes (-) are allowed within the username and domain parts of the email but are not mentioned for the top-level domain (e.g., .com, .edu).
- The @ symbol separates the username and domain parts of an email address.
- The domain name can include letters and may also include periods and dashes.
- The top-level domain is specified to be 2-4 alphabetical characters long.

1. `"[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,4}"`:
   - Matches alphanumeric characters, periods, and dashes in both the username and domain parts.
   - Enforces 2-4 alphabetical characters for the top-level domain.
   - This pattern closely follows the specified requirements for standard email addresses.

2. `"[a-zA-Z]+@[a-zA-Z]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,4}"`:
   - This pattern does not match digits or periods and dashes in the username and domain parts, making it too restrictive.

3. `"\w+@\w+\.\w{2,4}"`:
   - `\w` matches any word character (alphanumeric characters and underscores).
   - Does not specifically handle periods or dashes in the username and domain parts as required.
   - The pattern suggests that the top-level domain could include non-alphabetical characters due to `\w`, which deviates from the requirements.

4. `"[\w.-]+@\w+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,4}"`:
   - Matches alphanumeric characters, periods, and dashes in the username part, but not in the domain part before the top-level domain.
   - Enforces 2-4 alphabetical characters for the top-level domain.
   - Although close, it's not entirely correct since it does not allow periods and dashes in the domain part.

5. `"[a-zA-Z0-9_]+@[a-zA-Z]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,4}"`:
   - Includes underscores in the username part, which wasn't explicitly allowed per the requirements.
   - Does not account for periods and dashes in the username and domain parts as required.

## Correct Answer
1. `"[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,4}"`

## Reasoning
Option 1 is the correct answer as it encompasses all the required rules for identifying standard email addresses in a text according to the criteria provided:
- It allows for alphanumeric characters, periods, and dashes in both the username and domain parts of the email address.
- It specifies that the top-level domain must consist of 2-4 alphabetical characters, aligning with the requirements for standard email addresses.
