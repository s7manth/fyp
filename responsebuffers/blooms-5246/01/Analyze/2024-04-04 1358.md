## Question
You are developing a text mining application to identify and categorize user-generated content on a social media platform. In one of the tasks, you need to preprocess tweets to identify mentions of financial stock ticker symbols, conventionally represented by a dollar sign followed by the stock's uppercase ticker symbols (e.g., $AAPL for Apple Inc.). The goal is to match and extract full occurrences of these symbols without capturing simple dollar amounts or other context where the dollar sign might be used. Given this requirement, which of the following regular expressions should you use to analyze the tweets?

1. `\$[A-Z]+`
2. `\$[A-Z]{1,4}`
3. `(?<=\$)[A-Z]+`
4. `\$[A-Z]{2,4}`
5. `\$[A-Z]{1,5}\b`

## Solution

### Step-by-Step Approach

1. **Identify Requirements:**
   - Must start with a dollar sign `$`.
   - Must be followed by uppercase letters (ticker symbols).
   - Should not capture dollar amounts or non-ticker contexts.
   - Considering stock ticker symbols are usually 1 to 5 characters long.

2. **Analyze Regular Expression Options:**
   1. `\$[A-Z]+` matches a dollar sign followed by one or more uppercase letters. This could incorrectly include longer sequences that aren't valid stock tickers.
   2. `\$[A-Z]{1,4}` matches a dollar sign followed by 1 to 4 uppercase letters. This limits the length but could miss 5-letter ticker symbols.
   3. `(?<=\$)[A-Z]+` uses a positive lookbehind to ensure there's a dollar sign before the uppercase letters but does not limit the length of the ticker, potentially capturing longer sequences.
   4. `\$[A-Z]{2,4}` matches a dollar sign followed by 2 to 4 uppercase letters, excluding 1-letter tickers and not capturing 5-letter tickers.
   5. `\$[A-Z]{1,5}\b` matches a dollar sign followed by 1 to 5 uppercase letters, followed by a word boundary, ensuring that the match is a standalone ticker symbol.

3. **Evaluate Based on Requirements:**
   - Option (1) lacks specificity in terms of length.
   - Option (2) is close but doesn't account for potential 5-character ticker symbols.
   - Option (3) ignores the length requirement.
   - Option (4) doesn't include 1-character or 5-character ticker symbols.
   - Option (5) correctly identifies ticker symbols of 1 to 5 characters as independent words, aligning with the typical format of stock ticker symbols and ensuring they are neither longer sequences nor embedded within other words/text.

Therefore, the best choice is option 5: `\$[A-Z]{1,5}\b`.

## Correct Answer
5. `\$[A-Z]{1,5}\b`

## Reasoning
Option 5 is the correct answer because it specifically captures the dollar sign followed by 1 to 5 uppercase letters (matching the typical length of stock ticker symbols) and uses a word boundary (`\b`) to ensure the regex does not catch longer strings or symbols that are part of another word/context. This precise specification meets the requirements for identifying stock ticker symbols while avoiding common pitfalls like matching unrelated dollar amounts or longer sequences that aren't valid tickers.
