## Question

A data scientist is working on a sentiment analysis project focused on movie reviews. The dataset contains reviews in a poorly formatted manner with inconsistent use of whitespace, a mix of upper and lower case letters, and various non-alphanumeric characters not relevant to the analysis (e.g., emojis, HTML tags). The data scientist aims to preprocess the text data to make it more uniform and suitable for analysis. Which of the following preprocessing steps should be applied to achieve this goal?

1. Convert all text to upper case and remove all numerics.
2. Apply stemming, convert all text to lower case, and remove HTML tags.
3. Perform lemmatization, preserve case sensitivity, and keep non-alphanumeric characters.
4. Convert all text to lower case, remove non-alphanumeric characters except for basic punctuation, and strip excessive whitespace.
5. Only remove HTML tags without altering the case of the text or removing non-alphanumeric characters.

## Solution

The preprocessing steps for text data, especially in sentiment analysis, aim to normalize the data. This involves making the text uniform in terms of case sensitivity and removing irrelevant characters that do not contribute to sentiment analysis. The correct approach would involve:

1. **Converting all text to a uniform case**: This is usually lowercase, as it helps in the normalization process, making it easier for the analysis tool to recognize the same words regardless of their original case in the dataset.
2. **Removing irrelevant non-alphanumeric characters**: This includes emojis, HTML tags, and other characters not relevant to analyzing the sentiment. Basic punctuation can be preserved as it might help in understanding the sentiment (exclamation marks might indicate a strong feeling).
3. **Stripping excessive whitespace**: This step ensures that extra spaces do not affect the analysis process. Spaces are necessary to separate words, but multiple spaces do not carry additional meaning and can be cleaned.

Given these considerations, the steps that should be applied are:

- Convert all text to lower case to ensure uniformity.
- Remove non-alphanumeric characters that do not contribute to sentiment analysis, except for basic punctuation, which can be important for understanding the sentiment expressed in the reviews.
- Strip excessive whitespace to clean the data without affecting the semantic meaning of the sentences.

Hence, the correct option is:

**4. Convert all text to lower case, remove non-alphanumeric characters except for basic punctuation, and strip excessive whitespace.**

## Correct Answer

4. Convert all text to lower case, remove non-alphanumeric characters except for basic punctuation, and strip excessive whitespace.

## Reasoning

This preprocessing step aligns with the best practices in text data cleaning for sentiment analysis or similar text mining tasks. It includes necessary normalization processes, such as case uniformity and cleaning of irrelevant characters, to make the dataset uniform and ready for further analysis. This step effectively balances the need for a clean dataset with the preservation of meaningful punctuation that contributes to sentiment analysis, demonstrating an understanding of the application of text preprocessing theoretical concepts to practical scenarios.
