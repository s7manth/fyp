## Question

In the context of text mining, which of the following best describes the purpose of the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) weighting scheme?

1. To count the occurrences of each word in a single document.
2. To reduce the dimensionality of the text data by discarding less important features.
3. To measure the importance of a word within a collection of documents by considering how frequently it appears in a document relative to its frequency across all documents.
4. To calculate the cosine similarity between two document vectors in a vector space.
5. To encode categorical data before applying text mining algorithms.

## Solution

To arrive at the correct answer, let's analyze each of the given options:

1. Counting the occurrences of each word in a document refers to the term frequency (TF) part of TF-IDF, but it is incomplete as it does not take into account the inverse document frequency (IDF) part that considers the word's frequency across all documents.

2. Reducing the dimensionality of text data by discarding less important features is a potential effect of applying TF-IDF since it can help to highlight words that are particularly characteristic of a document. However, this description is more an outcome of the purpose of TF-IDF rather than its primary function.

3. This option comprehensively describes the TF-IDF weighting scheme. It incorporates both aspects of the approach – the frequency of a word in a specific document and its frequency across all documents – to measure a word's importance in the context of a collection of documents.

4. Calculating the cosine similarity between two document vectors is a method for determining document similarity in the vector space model. While TF-IDF can be used to create the vectors compared by cosine similarity, the description does not directly correspond to the purpose of TF-IDF itself.

5. Encoding categorical data is a preprocessing step in many text mining and machine learning algorithms, but it is not related to the principle or purpose of TF-IDF.

Thus, the correct answer explains the dual nature of TF-IDF: its representation of term frequency within a single document and the inverse document frequency component that provides a counterbalance for terms that appear frequently across multiple documents.

## Correct Answer

3. To measure the importance of a word within a collection of documents by considering how frequently it appears in a document relative to its frequency across all documents.

## Reasoning

The Purpose of Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) in text mining is to weigh the frequency of a word's occurrence in a specific document against the inverse of its frequency across a collection of documents. This dual approach helps to identify words that are uniquely significant within individual documents while also factoring in the word's commonness or rarity across the entire document corpus. The correct option encapsulates this nuanced balance, illustrating a foundational knowledge (Remember) of the role that TF-IDF plays in enhancing text mining applications by spotlighting the relative importance of words.
