## Question
Consider a scenario where you are developing a sentiment analysis model using a logistic regression classifier. The dataset consists of movie reviews, each labeled as positive or negative. You have decided to use word embeddings as features for your classifier. However, you notice that your model performs poorly on the test set. Which of the following could be a potential reason for the observed performance degradation?

1. The word embeddings were trained on a corpus of medical research papers, which is a domain significantly different from movie reviews.
2. The logistic regression model is overfitting due to a large number of features compared to the number of training samples.
3. The word embeddings are of very high dimensionality, causing the distance between any two points to be almost equal (curse of dimensionality).
4. The learning rate for the gradient descent optimization of the logistic regression is set too high, causing the model to overshoot the minimum of the cost function.
5. All of the above could be potential reasons for the poor performance of the sentiment analysis model.

## Learning Outcomes
The question is designed to achieve the following learning outcomes:
- Assess the student's understanding of the impact of domain-specific data on the performance of word embeddings.
- Evaluate the student's knowledge of the relationship between the number of features, the number of training samples, and the risk of overfitting.
- Test the student's comprehension of the curse of dimensionality and its effect on machine learning models.
- Examine the student's ability to identify issues related to optimization algorithms in the context of logistic regression.
- Encourage students to think critically about the multifaceted nature of model performance issues and the importance of considering all potential factors.

This question contributes to the students' mastery of natural language processing concepts by integrating knowledge of vector semantics, embeddings, and logistic regression, and by requiring them to analyze a practical problem that could arise in sentiment analysis tasks.

## Answer
The correct answer is:

5. All of the above could be potential reasons for the poor performance of the sentiment analysis model.

Explanation:

1. Word embeddings trained on a corpus from a different domain (medical research papers) may not capture the semantic nuances of words used in movie reviews. This domain shift can lead to poor feature representation for sentiment analysis in the movie review domain.

2. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including noise and outliers, which does not generalize well to unseen data. Having a large number of features (especially when using high-dimensional word embeddings) with respect to the number of training samples can lead to overfitting.

3. The curse of dimensionality refers to various phenomena that arise when analyzing and organizing data in high-dimensional spaces. In high dimensions, the volume of the space increases so quickly that the available data become sparse, and the distance between data points becomes less meaningful, which can negatively affect the performance of distance-based classifiers like logistic regression.

4. If the learning rate for gradient descent is set too high, the optimization algorithm may overshoot the minimum of the cost function, leading to poor convergence and, consequently, poor model performance.

Each of these reasons individually, as well as in combination, could contribute to the poor performance of the sentiment analysis model. Therefore, the students must consider all these aspects when diagnosing issues with machine learning models in natural language processing tasks.
