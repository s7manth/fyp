## Question

A team of data scientists is developing an NLP model to categorize customer reviews of a streaming service into one of three classes: positive, neutral, or negative. They decide to use Multinomial Logistic Regression for this multi-class classification problem. They also intend to use L2 regularization to prevent overfitting, given the high dimensionality of the data from text features. Considering the use of a one-vs-rest (OvR) scheme for the Multinomial Logistic Regression, which of the following equations correctly describes the gradient of the cross-entropy loss function with respect to the weight vector for a single class, incorporating L2 regularization?

1. $$\nabla_{w_j} J = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (y_{ij} - p(y_{ij}|x_i, w_j)) \cdot x_i + \lambda \cdot w_j$$
2. $$\nabla_{w_j} J = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (y_{ij} - p(y_{ij}|x_i, w_j)) \cdot x_i - \lambda \cdot \|w_j\|_1$$
3. $$\nabla_{w_j} J = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (p(y_{ij}|x_i, w_j) - y_{ij}) \cdot x_i + \lambda \cdot \|w_j\|_2$$
4. $$\nabla_{w_j} J = \sum_{i=1}^{N} (p(y_{ij}|x_i, w_j) - y_{ij}) \cdot x_i + \lambda \cdot w_j^2$$
5. $$\nabla_{w_j} J = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (p(y_{ij}|x_i, w_j) - y_{ij}) \cdot x_i + \lambda \cdot \|w_j\|_2^2$$

## Solution

The correct approach to solving this question involves:
1. Recognizing the structure and characteristics of Multinomial Logistic Regression, specifically in the context of an OvR scheme.
2. Understanding the formulation of the gradient of the cross-entropy loss function for logistic regression, especially when dealing with multiple classes.
3. Realizing the application and impact of L2 regularization on the gradient equation.

First, let's break down the components of the gradient calculation for the Multinomial Logistic Regression loss function with L2 regularization in a one-vs-rest context:

- The basic form of the gradient of the loss function for logistic regression without regularization is given by the derivative of the cross-entropy loss, which can be represented as the sum over all training examples of the product between the error in the prediction (the difference between the actual label $y_{ij}$ and the predicted probability $p(y_{ij}|x_i, w_j)$) and the feature vector $x_i$.
- For L2 regularization, the term added to the loss function is $\lambda \cdot \|w_j\|_2^2$ where $\lambda$ is the regularization strength and $\|w_j\|_2^2$ represents the square of the L2 norm of the weight vector $w_j$. This term penalizes large weights and helps to prevent overfitting by encouraging the model to maintain smaller weight values.
- The gradient of the regularized loss function, therefore, would include both the gradient from the cross-entropy loss and the derivative of the L2 regularization term, which is $2\lambda \cdot w_j$. However, in the context of formulation for gradient descent updates, this doubling is often incorporated into the regularization strength $\lambda$, simplifying the term to $\lambda \cdot w_j$.

Given these considerations, the corrected gradient equation for a weight vector $w_j$ of a single class in an OvR Multinomial Logistic Regression model with L2 regularization is:

$$\nabla_{w_j} J = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (p(y_{ij}|x_i, w_j) - y_{ij}) \cdot x_i + \lambda \cdot w_j$$

This corresponds to choice 1 in the given options.

## Correct Answer

1. $$\nabla_{w_j} J = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (y_{ij} - p(y_{ij}|x_i, w_j)) \cdot x_i + \lambda \cdot w_j$$

## Reasoning

The choice correctly identifies the gradient of the cross-entropy loss with L2 regularization in the context of Multinomial Logistic Regression employing a one-vs-rest scheme. It correctly includes both components:
- The average of the product of the prediction error and feature vectors across all training examples, correctly indicating the direction of the gradient for minimization.
- The addition of the L2 regularization term, $\lambda \cdot w_j$, reflecting the penalty on the magnitude of the weights to prevent overfitting, and thereby maintaining the generalization ability of the model.

Choices 2 and 5 incorrectly describe the regularization term (using either the L1 norm or incorrectly squaring the L2 norm). Choice 3 has the prediction error formula inverted, which does not align with the correct definition of the gradient of the loss. Choice 4 fails to average the sum over all training examples and incorrectly squares the regularization term, disregarding the proper formulation of L2 regularization in the gradient.
