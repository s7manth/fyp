## Question
In natural language processing (NLP), sentiment analysis is a common task that involves classifying texts according to the sentiment expressed in them. Suppose you're implementing a sentiment analysis model to classify movie reviews into three categories: positive, neutral, and negative, using multinomial logistic regression. Your features are derived from the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) values of the words in the reviews, and you're applying L2 regularization to combat overfitting due to the high dimensionality of your feature space. 

Given this scenario, which of the following expressions accurately represents the gradient of the cross-entropy loss function with respect to the weight vector for one class k in your multinomial logistic regression model, where $N$ is the number of training examples, $M$ is the number of classes, $x_i$ is the feature vector of the $i^{th}$ training example, $y_i$ is the actual class label of the $i^{th}$ training example (with $y_i = k$ if the example belongs to class k), $\theta_k$ is the weight vector for class k, and $\lambda$ is the regularization parameter?

1. $$\frac{\partial J(\theta)}{\partial \theta_k} = - \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N x_i (1\{y_i = k\} - P(y_i = k|x_i; \theta)) + \lambda \sum_{j=1}^M \theta_j$$
2. $$\frac{\partial J(\theta)}{\partial \theta_k} = - \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N x_i (1\{y_i = k\} - P(y_i = k|x_i; \theta)) + 2\lambda \theta_k$$
3. $$\frac{\partial J(\theta)}{\partial \theta_k} = - \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N (1\{y_i = k\} - P(y_i = k|x_i; \theta)) + \lambda \theta_k$$
4. $$\frac{\partial J(\theta)}{\partial \theta_k} = - \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N x_i^T (1\{y_i = k\} - P(y_i = k|x_i; \theta))$$
5. $$\frac{\partial J(\theta)}{\partial \theta_k} = - \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N x_i (1\{y_i = k\} - P(y_i = k|x_i; \theta)) + \lambda \theta_k$$

## Solution
The correct answer is option 2.

To arrive at this solution, we need to understand several components of multinomial logistic regression, the cross-entropy loss function, and the L2 regularization.

Firstly, the cross-entropy loss function for multinomial logistic regression can be expressed as:
$$J(\theta) = -\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{k=1}^M 1\{y_i = k\} \log(P(y_i = k|x_i; \theta))$$

The probability $P(y_i = k|x_i; \theta)$ is calculated using the softmax function applied to the linear combination of the input features $x_i$ and the weight vector $\theta$ for class k.

L2 regularization is added to the loss function to penalize large weights, and it is represented as:
$$\lambda \sum_{j=1}^M ||\theta_j||^2$$

When computing the gradient of the loss function with respect to the weight vector $\theta_k$ for a particular class k, we also need to include the derivative of the regularization term. The derivative of the L2 regularization term with respect to $\theta_k$ is $2\lambda \theta_k$.

Combining these components, the gradient for class k is:
- The average difference between the actual presence of class k (represented by $1\{y_i = k\}$) and the predicted probability of class k ($P(y_i = k|x_i; \theta)$) weighted by the feature vector $x_i$.
- Plus the derivative of the regularization term, which is $2\lambda \theta_k$ (since the derivative of $||\theta_k||^2$ with respect to $\theta_k$ is $2\theta_k$).

Therefore, we arrive at:
$$\frac{\partial J(\theta)}{\partial \theta_k} = - \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N x_i (1\{y_i = k\} - P(y_i = k|x_i; \theta)) + 2\lambda \theta_k$$

## Correct Answer
2. $$\frac{\partial J(\theta)}{\partial \theta_k} = - \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N x_i (1\{y_i = k\} - P(y_i = k|x_i; \theta)) + 2\lambda \theta_k$$

## Reasoning
The correct option incorporates both the derivative of the cross-entropy loss function with respect to the weights for a given class (indicative of how the prediction error should influence the update of the weights) and the derivative of the L2 regularization term (which imposes a penalty on the magnitude of the weights to prevent overfitting). The presence of the term $2\lambda \theta_k$ specifically indicates the application of L2 regularization, which is critical in scenarios where models might overfit due to high dimensionality, as is common with TF-IDF features in NLP tasks like sentiment analysis. This solution requires an understanding of both the theoretical underpinnings of multinomial logistic regression and the practical implications of regularization.
