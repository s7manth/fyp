## Question
Consider a scenario where you are developing a feedforward neural network (FNN) for a classification task in a natural language processing (NLP) application. Your goal is to classify text data into one of two possible classes. The dataset is highly imbalanced, with 90% of the data belonging to one class and the remaining 10% to the other. You decide to address this imbalance by modifying the loss function. Assuming a binary classification task and using a standard softmax output layer, which of the following modifications to the traditional cross-entropy loss function would you consider most effective for training your model under these conditions?

1. Incorporate class weights inversely proportional to the class frequencies.
2. Replace cross-entropy loss with mean squared error (MSE) loss.
3. Use cross-entropy loss without modifications but balance the dataset by over-sampling the minority class.
4. Apply a sigmoid activation function on the output layer instead of softmax.
5. Increase the learning rate during training to compensate for the imbalanced dataset.

## Solution

First, let's address the imbalance in the dataset and its impact on the model training. A highly imbalanced dataset can lead to a model that is biased towards the majority class, as it minimizes the loss by predicting the majority class most of the time. This can result in poor generalization performance, especially for the minority class.

Option 1 suggests incorporating class weights that are inversely proportional to their frequencies. This approach directly addresses the class imbalance by penalizing the misclassification of the minority class more than that of the majority class. It modifies the loss function in such a way that the model is "forced" to pay more attention to examples from the minority class, thereby learning features from both classes more effectively.

Option 2 suggests replacing the cross-entropy loss with the mean squared error (MSE) loss. While MSE can be used for classification tasks, it is not as effective as cross-entropy loss because MSE does not amplify the errors for incorrect predictions to the same extent, especially when the output probabilities are interpreted as class probabilities in a classification task.

Option 3 is about using the same cross-entropy loss but balancing the dataset by over-sampling the minority class. While this approach does not modify the loss function, it addresses the dataset's imbalance and can be effective. However, over-sampling might introduce its own set of issues, such as overfitting to the minority class.

Option 4 proposes changing the activation function of the output layer to sigmoid instead of softmax. In a binary classification task, both softmax and sigmoid can be appropriate, but changing to sigmoid alone does not address the issue of the imbalanced dataset directly through the loss function.

Option 5 suggests increasing the learning rate to compensate for the imbalanced dataset. However, simply increasing the learning rate might not specifically address the class imbalance issue and can potentially lead to other training problems, like overshooting minima or causing the gradient to diverge.

Given these considerations, option 1 is the most effective modification to the loss function for handling the described imbalanced dataset situation.

## Correct Answer

1. Incorporate class weights inversely proportional to the class frequencies.

## Reasoning

Incorporating class weights inversely proportional to the class frequencies directly modifies the loss function to account for the imbalance in the dataset. This method makes the model more sensitive to the minority class by assigning a higher penalty to misclassifications of the minority class. This adjustment ensures that the training process does not favor the majority class overwhelmingly, leading to a more balanced consideration of both classes during model training. This approach is a practical and commonly recommended solution for dealing with class imbalance in classification tasks, making it the best choice among the provided options.
