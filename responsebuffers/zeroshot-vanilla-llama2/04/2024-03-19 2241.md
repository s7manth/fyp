## Problem Statement
You are given a dataset of customer purchases from an online retailer, where each purchase is represented by a set of features such as product category, quantity purchased, and total cost. The task is to train a logistic regression model that can predict the probability of a customer making a purchase based on their past purchases. The model should be able to handle both categorical and numerical features.

## Choices

1. Which type of regression is this example most similar to?
a) Linear Regression
b) Polynomial Regression
c) Logistic Regression
d) Decision Tree Regression
e) Random Forest Regression

2. What is the purpose of the sigmoid function in logistic regression?
a) To transform the output into a probability value

c) To reduce the dimensionality of the input space
d) To introduce non-linearity to the model
e) To perform feature selection

3. Which of the following is NOT a classification task for logistic regression?
