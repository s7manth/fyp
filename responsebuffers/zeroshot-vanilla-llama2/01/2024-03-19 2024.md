## Problem Statement
You are given a collection of text data containing customer reviews of products on an e-commerce website. The task is to develop a natural language processing (NLP) system that can automatically extract useful information from the reviews, such as sentiment, topics, and keywords. Design an MCQ question that tests students' understanding of NLP concepts and their ability to apply them to practical scenarios.

## Choices

1. Which of the following NLP techniques would be most suitable for sentiment analysis of customer reviews?
a) Regular Expressions
b) Text Normalization
c) Edit Distance
d) Words
e) Corpora
2. What tool would you use to tokenize words in a text corpus?
a) Simple Unix Tools
b) Word Tokenization
c) Lemmatization
d) Stemming
e) Sentence Segmentation
3. How would you approach the problem of word normalization in customer reviews?
a) By removing stop words and punctuation only
b) By lemmatizing all words before normalization
c) By using a pre-defined set of normalized words for each topic
d) By using a combination of methods (e.g., stemming, lemmatization, and word removal)
4. What is the main advantage of using a corpus in NLP?
a) To improve the accuracy of sentiment analysis
b) To reduce the dimensionality of text data
c) To provide context for word meanings
d) To enable more efficient processing of large text datasets
5. Which of the following would be the most appropriate method for sentence segmentation in customer reviews?
a) Use a fixed-length window approach
b) Apply a machine learning model to classify sentences based on their structure
c) Use a combination of rule-based and machine learning approaches
d) Use a hybrid approach combining both rule-based and machine learning methods

## Solution

1. The correct answer is (a) Regular Expressions. Sentiment analysis involves identifying the overall emotional tone of a piece of text, which can be done using regular expressions to match patterns in the text that indicate positive or negative sentiment. Text normalization techniques such as tokenization and stemming are important preparatory steps for sentiment analysis, but they are not sufficient on their own to capture the full range of sentiment expressed in customer reviews.
2. The correct answer is (a) Simple Unix Tools. Word tokenization involves breaking up text into individual words or phrases, which can be done using simple Unix tools such as cut or sed. More advanced tools such as NLTK or spaCy offer more sophisticated techniques for word tokenization, but for a basic task like this, Simple Unix Tools are sufficient.
3. The correct answer is (d) Use a combination of methods. Word normalization involves transforming words to a standard form to reduce confusion and improve analysis. This can be done using a combination of methods such as stemming, lemmatization, and stop word removal. Each method has its advantages and disadvantages, so a hybrid approach that combines them is likely to produce the best results.
4. The correct answer is (d) Use a hybrid approach combining both rule-based and machine learning methods. Corpora can provide valuable context for word meanings, improving the accuracy of NLP tasks like sentiment analysis and topic modeling. By combining rule-based and machine learning approaches, it is possible to leverage the strengths of each while avoiding their limitations.
5. The correct answer is (b) Apply a machine learning model to classify sentences based on their structure. Sentence segmentation involves identifying the boundaries between individual sentences in a text corpus. Machine learning models can be trained to recognize patterns in sentence structure that indicate the start and end of a sentence, allowing for more accurate segmentation than rule-based approaches alone.

## Reasoning

For each question, the solution should explain the thought process, reasoning, and step-by-step approach required to arrive at the correct answer. The solution should demonstrate a deep understanding of the underlying concepts and their practical applications in NLP.
