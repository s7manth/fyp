## Problem Statement
You are given a collection of text data containing sentences from various genres, styles, and languages. Your task is to develop a natural language processing pipeline that can handle the following tasks:

1. Tokenize the text into individual words or subwords.
2. Remove stop words and punctuation.
3. Lemmatize each word using a dictionary of word stems.
4. Stem the words further by reducing them to their base form.
5. Normalize the text by removing any remaining irregularities in spelling, capitalization, or syntax.

Your pipeline should be able to handle different languages and genres while maintaining the accuracy and efficiency of the processing steps.

## Choices
Choose the correct step(s) from the following options to complete the natural language processing pipeline:

A. Text Normalization
B. Word Tokenization
C. Lemmatization
D. Stemming
E. Sentence Segmentation

Please select one option from the following choices:

A. Text Normalization
B. Word Tokenization
C. Lemmatization
D. Stemming
E. Sentence Segmentation

## Solution
The correct answer is (C) Lemmatization. Lemmatization is an essential step in natural language processing as it helps to reduce the dimensionality of words and make them more easily comparable or analyzable. By using a dictionary of word stems, you can transform each word into its base form, which can simplify further analysis or comparison of the text data.

To justify this answer, consider the following reasoning:

1. Tokenization is essential to break down the text into individual words or subwords, but it may not be sufficient on its own to handle variations in spelling, capitalization, or syntax.
2. Word normalization can help to reduce the impact of irregularities in spelling or syntax, but it may not address issues with word forms that are inherently irregular, such as irregularly spelled words or words with multiple base forms.
3. Lemmatization can help to address these issues by reducing each word to its base form, which can simplify further analysis or comparison of the text data.
4. Sentence segmentation is important for analyzing the structure of sentences and identifying their meaning, but it may not be directly relevant to lemmatization.
5. Text normalization can help to reduce the impact of variations in spelling, capitalization, or syntax, but it may not address issues with word forms that are inherently irregular.

Therefore, option (C) Lemmatization is the correct answer.
