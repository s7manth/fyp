## Problem Statement
You are given a dataset of customer reviews for a popular restaurant. The goal is to train a Naive Bayes classifier to classify the reviews as either "positive" or "negative". However, there are some challenges that you must address:

* The dataset contains reviews with sentiment labels that are not always accurate (e.g., some positive reviews may contain negative language).
* Some review phrases are ambiguous and could be classified in multiple ways (e.g., "the food was good" could be classified as positive or negative).
* The restaurant has a diverse customer base, which means that the classifier must be able to handle different types of language and cultural references.

Your task is to train a Naive Bayes classifier that can accurately classify the reviews while taking these challenges into account.

## Choices
Choose the best solution to the problem statement:

A) Use a pre-trained language model as the feature extractor and train the classifier directly on the sentiment labeled reviews.
B) Use a sentiment analysis tool to preprocess the reviews and then train the classifier on the preprocessed data.
C) Use a combination of word embeddings and a Naive Bayes classifier to handle the ambiguity in the review phrases.
D) Train a separate classifier for each type of language or cultural reference in the dataset.
E) Use a hybrid approach that combines multiple techniques, such as using a pre-trained language model as a feature extractor and then training a Naive Bayes classifier on the extracted features.

## Solution
The best solution is (C) Use a combination of word embeddings and a Naive Bayes classifier to handle the ambiguity in the review phrases. This approach combines the strengths of both techniques:

1. Word embeddings can capture the semantic meaning of words and phrases, allowing the classifier to handle ambiguous language more effectively.
2. The Naive Bayes classifier can handle the imbalanced classes in the dataset (i.e., there are more positive than negative reviews) by using the word embeddings as features.
3. By combining both techniques, we can leverage the strengths of each to improve the overall performance of the classifier.

## Reasoning
The reasoning for this answer is as follows:

A) Using a pre-trained language model as the feature extractor may not capture the nuances of language and sentiment in the reviews, especially if the model is not trained on similar datasets.

B) Sentiment analysis can be useful for preprocessing the reviews, but it may not handle the ambiguity in the review phrases effectively.

D) Training multiple classifiers for each type of language or cultural reference may lead to overfitting and reduced generalization performance.

E) A hybrid approach can be effective, but it may require more complex engineering and tuning to combine the different techniques properly. Word embeddings and Naive Bayes classifier can work well together by capturing both semantic and syntactic aspects of language.

## Evaluation
The evaluation metric for this problem is F-measure, which takes into account both precision and recall. The ideal solution should have a high F-measure score, indicating good performance on both the positive and negative classes.
