## Problem Statement
You are given a dataset of customer reviews for a restaurant, with 1000 samples. The task is to train a Naive Bayes classifier to predict the rating (1-5 stars) based on the text of the review. The dataset is imbalanced, with 60% of the reviews being 4 or 5 stars, and 40% being 1 or 2 stars. You want to optimize the model for sentiment analysis and evaluate its performance using appropriate metrics.

## Choices

A) Train a Naive Bayes classifier on the entire dataset without any preprocessing or feature selection.
B) Use TF-IDF weighting scheme to transform the text data before training the Naive Bayes classifier.
C) Apply a domain-specific preprocessing step (e.g., removing stop words, stemming, lemmatization) before training the model.
D) Split the dataset into training and validation sets and use cross-validation to evaluate the model's performance.
E) Use statistical significance testing to determine the relevance of individual features in the review text for predicting the rating.

## Solution
To solve this problem, we will choose option B: Use TF-IDF weighting scheme to transform the text data before training the Naive Bayes classifier. We will explain the reasoning behind our choice and provide a step-by-step approach to implement the solution.

Reasoning:
Naive Bayes relies on Bayes' theorem, which assumes that each feature is independent of the others. However, in text classification tasks, this assumption can be violated due to the high correlation between features. TF-IDF weighting scheme addresses this issue by calculating the importance of each term (i.e., feature) based on its frequency in the entire corpus and its importance in the specific document. By doing so, TF-IDF reduces the impact of irrelevant features and improves the model's performance.

Step-by-step approach:

1. Load the dataset and preprocess it by removing stop words, punctuation, and any other irrelevant information.
2. Calculate the TF-IDF weighting scheme for each term in the preprocessed text data.
3. Train a Naive Bayes classifier on the weighted text data using the entire dataset as input.
4. Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics, such as precision, recall, and F-measure.
5. Fine-tune the model by adjusting the hyperparameters or adding more features to improve its performance.

## Reasoning
Our approach is based on the understanding that TF-IDF weighting scheme helps reduce the impact of irrelevant features in text classification tasks, leading to better model performance. By preprocessing the text data and applying the TF-IDF weighting scheme, we can improve the accuracy of the Naive Bayes classifier.

## Problem Statement
You are given a dataset of news articles from various sources on a particular topic (e.g., politics, sports, entertainment). The task is to train a Naive Bayes classifier to predict the sentiment of each article (positive, negative, or neutral) based on its content. The dataset contains 5000 articles, with an even distribution of positive and negative sentiment. You want to optimize the model for sentiment analysis and evaluate its performance using appropriate metrics.
