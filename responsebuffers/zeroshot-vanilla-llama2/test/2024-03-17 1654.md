Question:
A natural language processing toolkit is developing a new feature to analyze the sentiment of social media posts. The toolkit wants to use a machine learning model to classify posts as positive, negative, or neutral based on their content. Which of the following methods would you recommend for this task?

A) Using regular expressions to extract keywords from the text and then classifying them based on their frequency in the corpus.
B) Normalizing the text using a standardization technique such as TF-IDF, and then feeding it into a machine learning model.
C) Calculating the edit distance between the input text and a set of pre-defined templates to determine its sentiment.
D) Using a simple Unix tool such as `wc` to count the number of words in the input text and then classifying it based on that metric.
E) Combining multiple techniques, such as word normalization and lemmatization, to improve the accuracy of the sentiment classification model.

Solution:
The correct answer is (D) Using a simple Unix tool such as `wc` to count the number of words in the input text and then classifying it based on that metric. This method is the simplest and most straightforward approach for analyzing the sentiment of social media posts. It does not require any preprocessing or feature extraction, and can be easily implemented using a simple command-line tool.

Reasoning:
The goal of the toolkit is to classify social media posts as positive, negative, or neutral based on their content. The number of words in a post is a crucial aspect of its sentiment, as more wordy posts are generally considered more positive than shorter ones. By using `wc` to count the number of words in each post, we can easily classify them based on this metric. This method is also quick and easy to implement, making it a good choice for real-time analysis of social media data.
