## Problem Statement
You are given a dataset of customer reviews for a popular restaurant. The task is to build a language model that can generate coherent and fluent text based on this dataset, with the ability to fine-tune the model for specific tasks such as sentiment analysis or text generation.

## Choices

1. Build a bidirectional transformer encoder to capture both forward and backward dependencies in the data.
2. Use masked language models to train the model on unseen data, improving its ability to generalize to new texts.
3. Fine-tune the pre-trained BERT model on your dataset to adapt it to your specific task.
4. Use contextual embeddings to capture the relationships between words in a sentence and improve the model's understanding of language context.
5. Implement advanced span-based masking techniques to improve the model's ability to handle long-range dependencies.

## Solution
To solve this problem, we will build a fine-tuned BERT model using a combination of the techniques listed above. We will start by preprocessing the customer reviews dataset, removing stop words and punctuation, and converting the text to lowercase. We will then use the bidirectional transformer encoder to capture both forward and backward dependencies in the data.

Next, we will use masked language models to train the model on unseen data, improving its ability to generalize to new texts. We will use a combination of random masking and span-based masking to create a more robust model.

Once the model is trained, we will fine-tune the pre-trained BERT model on our dataset to adapt it to our specific task. This involves adding a task-specific output layer and training the entire model on our dataset using a combination of cross-entropy loss and masked language modeling.

Finally, we will use contextual embeddings to capture the relationships between words in a sentence and improve the model's understanding of language context. We will also implement advanced span-based masking techniques to improve the model's ability to handle long-range dependencies.

## Reasoning
The reasoning behind this solution is as follows:

* Bidirectional transformer encoders are effective at capturing both forward and backward dependencies in the data, allowing the model to understand the relationships between words in a sentence and their context.
* Masked language models are useful for training the model on unseen data, improving its ability to generalize to new texts. By combining random masking and span-based masking, we can create a more robust model that is able to handle a variety of input types.
* Fine-tuning a pre-trained BERT model allows us to adapt the model to our specific task without requiring additional training data. This can save time and resources compared to training a model from scratch.
* Contextual embeddings provide important information about the relationships between words in a sentence, allowing the model to better understand language context.
* Advanced span-based masking techniques can help the model handle long-range dependencies more effectively, allowing it to generate more coherent and fluent text.
