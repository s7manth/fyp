## Problem Statement
You are given a language model that has been trained on a large corpus of text data. The task is to evaluate the quality of the model and identify any potential issues with its training. Choose the best answer to complete the following statement:

The model's perplexity on a test set is _______________, indicating that it has difficulty generalizing to unseen data.

## Choices
A) High
B) Medium
C) Low
D) Very Low
E) Unknown

## Solution
The correct answer is (C) Low. Perplexity measures how well a language model can predict the next word in a sequence given the previous words. A low perplexity indicates that the model has difficulty generalizing to unseen data, which could be due to overfitting or underfitting the training data. To address this issue, techniques such as smoothing, sampling, and regularization can be applied.

## Reasoning
The reasoning behind choosing (C) Low is that perplexity is a measure of how well a language model can predict the next word in a sequence given the previous words. A low perplexity indicates that the model has difficulty generalizing to unseen data, which could be due to overfitting or underfitting the training data. Overfitting occurs when a model becomes too complex and learns the noise in the training data rather than the underlying patterns, leading to poor generalization performance on unseen data. Underfitting occurs when a model is not complex enough and cannot capture the underlying patterns in the training data, leading to poor performance on both the training and test data. To address this issue, techniques such as smoothing, sampling, and regularization can be applied.
