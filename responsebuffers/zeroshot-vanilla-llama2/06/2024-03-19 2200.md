## Problem Statement
You are given a dataset of 10,000 sentences, each labeled with one of three categories: "positive", "negative", or "neutral". Your task is to train a feed forward Neural Network to classify new sentences into these categories. The network must be trained on the given dataset and must produce accurate labels for new sentences it has not seen before.

## Choices

1. The XOR problem is a well-known classification problem that can be solved using a simple neural network architecture.
2. A feed forward Neural Network with one hidden layer and 100 neurons can be trained to classify sentences using the given dataset.
3. To train the Neural Network, you must use stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with a learning rate of 0.01 and a batch size of 32.
4. The network will overfit the training data if the number of hidden neurons is too small or too large.
5. To improve the generalization of the Neural Network, you can use techniques such as data augmentation, regularization, or ensembling.

## Solution
To solve this problem, we must first analyze the given dataset and identify any patterns or features that distinguish the different categories. We can then use these features to train a feed forward Neural Network with one hidden layer and 100 neurons.

Using the XOR problem as a starting point, we can see that the network will be able to classify new sentences into the three categories with high accuracy. However, we must also consider overfitting, which can occur if the network has too many parameters relative to the amount of training data available. To address this issue, we can use techniques such as regularization or ensembling to improve the generalization of the network.

To train the network, we will use stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with a learning rate of 0.01 and a batch size of 32. This will allow us to optimize the network's parameters in a gradual and iterative manner, while also avoiding overfitting.

Once the network is trained, we can evaluate its performance on a test set of sentences to determine its accuracy. If the network is not accurate enough, we may need to adjust the hyperparameters or try different techniques to improve its generalization.

## Reasoning
The reasoning behind this solution is based on the principles of feed forward Neural Networks and their ability to classify data using patterns and features learned from the training set. By analyzing the given dataset and identifying any relevant patterns or features, we can train a simple neural network architecture that can accurately classify new sentences into the three categories.

However, overfitting is a common problem in Neural Networks, especially when dealing with small datasets. To address this issue, we must consider techniques such as regularization or ensembling to improve the generalization of the network. By using a combination of these techniques and carefully tuning the hyperparameters, we can train a Neural Network that produces accurate labels for new sentences it has not seen before.

In summary, the solution to this problem involves analyzing the given dataset, training a feed forward Neural Network with one hidden layer and 100 neurons, using techniques such as regularization or ensembling to improve generalization, and using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) to optimize the network's parameters. By carefully considering these factors, we can train a Neural Network that accurately classifies new sentences into the three categories.
