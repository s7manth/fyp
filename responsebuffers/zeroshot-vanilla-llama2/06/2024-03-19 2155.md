## Problem Statement
You are given a dataset of text classifications, where each example is represented as a bag-of-words (BoW) vector. Your task is to train a feedforward neural network for text classification using a multi-class classification setting. The goal is to achieve the highest possible accuracy while minimizing the number of classes in the model.

## Choices

1. Use a single hidden layer with a softmax output layer to classify the examples into 5 different categories.
2. Use a combination of word embeddings and a recurrent neural network (RNN) to classify the examples into 3 different categories.
3. Train a separate neural network for each category in the dataset, and then combine their outputs using majority voting.
4. Use a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a spatial pyramid pooling layer to classify the examples into 2 different categories.
5. Use a hybrid model that combines a CNN with a RNN to classify the examples into 3 different categories.

## Solution
To solve this problem, we will use a feedforward neural network with a single hidden layer and a softmax output layer. The reason for this choice is twofold: firstly, the multi-class classification setting requires a model that can handle more than two classes, which is easily achievable with a single hidden layer; secondly, the softmax output layer allows us to compute the probability distribution over the different classes, which is useful for evaluating the accuracy of the model.

The neural network architecture will consist of an input layer, a single hidden layer, and an output layer. The input layer will take in the bag-of-words vector representations of the examples, and each example will be represented by a vector of size $d$, where $d$ is the number of unique words in the dataset. The hidden layer will have a number of neurons equal to the square root of the total number of features in the input layer, i.e., $\sqrt{d}$. The output layer will have a number of neurons equal to the number of classes in the classification task, and each neuron will represent one of the classes.

The training process will involve feeding the training examples into the neural network, adjusting the weights and biases of the neurons in the hidden layer using backpropagation, and then computing the output probabilities for each example using the softmax function. The training process will be repeated until the model converges to a minimum error value.

Once the model is trained, we can use it to classify new examples by feeding them into the input layer and computing their output probabilities in the output layer. We can then compare these probabilities to the true labels of the examples to evaluate the accuracy of the model.

## Reasoning
The reasoning behind our choice of neural network architecture is as follows:

1. **Single hidden layer**: A single hidden layer is sufficient for this problem because the number of classes is relatively small compared to the number of features in the input layer. Using a larger number of hidden neurons would not provide any significant improvement in accuracy, while increasing the risk of overfitting.
2. **Softmax output layer**: The softmax function is used to compute the probability distribution over the different classes in the output layer. This allows us to evaluate the accuracy of the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
3. **Square root of the total number of features**: The number of neurons in the hidden layer is proportional to the square root of the total number of features in the input layer. This ensures that the neural network has enough capacity to learn the underlying patterns in the data without overfitting.
4. **Training process**: The training process involves feeding the examples into the neural network, adjusting the weights and biases of the neurons using backpropagation, and then computing the output probabilities for each example using the softmax function. This process is repeated until the model converges to a minimum error value, which ensures that the model is trained to make accurate predictions on new examples.

In summary, our choice of neural network architecture is guided by the principle of simplicity and efficiency. By using a single hidden layer with a softmax output layer, we can achieve high accuracy while minimizing the number of classes in the model.
