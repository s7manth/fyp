## Question
You are developing a sentiment analysis model to understand user reviews on various tech products. Your approach utilizes word embeddings to convert words into vectors for processing. For feature selection, you decide to enhance your model by diminishing the influence of common but less informative words across documents, while highlighting unique, informative ones within specific documents. Which of the following techniques best fits your requirement to adjust the word vectors accordingly?

1. Applying Cosine Similarity on the word vectors to reduce dimensionality.
2. Employing Term Frequency (TF) to emphasize the recurrence of words in documents.
3. Utilizing Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) to weigh words' importance.
4. Leveraging Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) to measure word co-occurrences significantly.
5. Implementing Word2Vec Skip-Gram model to capture contextual information for each word.

## Solution
To enhance the sentiment analysis model by diminishing the influence of common but less informative words across documents while emphasizing unique, informative ones within specific documents, the best approach is to utilize the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) technique.

**Step-by-step approach:**

1. **Term Frequency (TF)**: Calculates how frequently a term occurs in a document. While useful, it does not consider the importance of a word across multiple documents.

2. **Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)**: This metric evaluates how important a word is across a set of documents. It diminishes the weight of terms that occur very frequently across the documents and increases the weight of terms that occur rarely.

3. **TF-IDF**: By combining TF and IDF, this technique weighs the frequency of words occurring in a document against the inverse document frequency of the word across a set of documents. This helps in identifying words that are unique and informative to specific documents (in this case, user reviews) by penalizing common words across all documents and promoting terms that are particularly unique to a document.

4. **Applying TF-IDF in sentiment analysis**: When applied to the word vectors in sentiment analysis, the TF-IDF technique adjusted the feature space so that it emphasizes words that are pivotal in determining sentiment unique to specific products, while diminishing the impact of common, less informative words. This nuanced weighting can significantly improve the performance of the model by focusing on the most discriminative terms.

## Correct Answer
3. Utilizing Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) to weigh words' importance.

## Reasoning
The rationale behind choosing TF-IDF over the other options is founded on its ability to highlight words that are uniquely relevant to certain documents (user reviews, in this case) by considering not just the word's frequency in individual documents (TF) but also how commonly or uncommonly it appears across all documents (IDF). Unlike Cosine Similarity, which is a measure of similarity between two vectors, or the Word2Vec Skip-Gram model, which captures contextual information but does not inherently weigh word importance based on their occurrence across documents, TF-IDF directly addresses the need to balance the frequency of words with their informativeness across a corpus. PMI, while useful for analyzing word co-occurrences, does not capture the unique importance of words in the context of their document frequency across a larger corpus. Hence, for diminishing the influence of common, less informative words and highlighting unique, informative ones, TF-IDF is the most appropriate technique.
