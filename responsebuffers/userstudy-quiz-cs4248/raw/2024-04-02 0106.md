## Question
A data scientist is building a next-word prediction model for a mobile keyboard app that requires the model to be both efficient and reasonably accurate. The dataset comprises diverse sources, including social media posts, news articles, and technical manuals. Given the diversity of the dataset and the need for real-time prediction with limited hardware resources, the data scientist considers various N-gram language models and smoothing techniques. Which of the following options best balances model size, complexity, and prediction quality for this application?

1. A unigram model with Laplace smoothing
2. A bigram model with Good-Turing smoothing
3. A trigram model with Kneser-Ney smoothing
4. A quadrigram model without any smoothing
5. A 5-gram model with Stupid Backoff

## Solution

The key factors affecting the choice of language model and smoothing technique are the diversity of the dataset, the real-time prediction requirement, and limited hardware resources. 

- **A unigram model with Laplace smoothing** is simple and requires less computational resources but is too primitive for diverse datasets and real-time prediction because it doesn't capture the context effectively.
- **A bigram model with Good-Turing smoothing** improves over unigram models by considering pairwise context, and Good-Turing smoothing helps with unseen bigrams. However, it might not balance the diversity efficiently due to its limited context.
- **A trigram model with Kneser-Ney smoothing** strikes a better balance between capturing enough contextual information and computational efficiency. Kneser-Ney smoothing is particularly effective in handling zero probabilities for unseen contexts in diverse datasets.
- **A quadrigram model without any smoothing** would potentially offer good prediction quality due to capturing a wider context but would suffer significantly in scenarios where the exact quadrigram hasn't been seen before, making it impractical for real-time predictions and devices with limited hardware resources.
- **A 5-gram model with Stupid Backoff** increases context size further, which could theoretically improve accuracy but at the expense of significantly greater computational and memory requirements. Stupid Backoff is a simpler technique that does not probabilistically normalize unseen N-grams, making it less accurate than other smoothing methods.

Considering efficiency, accuracy, and the ability to deal with dataset diversity, the best choice is **a trigram model with Kneser-Ney smoothing** because it provides a good balance by capturing more context than unigrams and bigrams while still being computationally feasible for real-time predictions on devices with limited hardware resources. Kneser-Ney smoothing is adept at handling the zero-probability issue for unseen N-grams, which is crucial for a diverse dataset.

## Correct Answer

3. A trigram model with Kneser-Ney smoothing

## Reasoning

The reasoning lies in the need to balance the model's size and complexity with the prediction quality. A trigram model, which considers the two previous words to predict the next word, provides a reasonable compromise between capturing enough contextual information for accurate prediction and maintaining computational efficiency. This is crucial for a mobile keyboard app that operates in real-time and on devices with limited computational capacity. Kneser-Ney smoothing is chosen because it is superior at dealing with zero probabilities for unseen N-grams without significantly increasing the model size, making it ideal for diverse datasets where encountering unseen word combinations is likely. This choice offers the best balance for the stated requirements of efficiency, prediction quality, and handling a diverse dataset.
