To determine the most plausible reason for the observation where training loss decreases but validation loss remains constant, let's evaluate each option:

1. **Learning Rate Too High**: If the learning rate were too high, the network weights would oscillate or diverge, leading to an increase rather than a decrease in training loss. Therefore, this is not the most likely reason given the described scenario.

2. **Network Too Simple (Underfitting)**: If the network is underfitting, both training and validation loss would be high and possibly decrease at a similar rate, as the model fails to capture both the training and validation data's underlying patterns. The scenario here demonstrates a decrease in training loss, indicating that underfitting is less likely the core issue.

3. **Noise in the Dataset**: While noise can impact performance, it would generally affect both training and validation loss. The specific pattern of the validation loss stagnating while the training loss decreases is not typically the direct result of noisy data.

4. **Lack of Dropout (Overfitting)**: Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, capturing noise and outliers in the training data that don't generalize to unseen data. Without regularization techniques like dropout, a network may overfit, resulting in a decreasing training loss and a stagnant or increasing validation loss. This situation aligns with the described observation.

5. **Softmax Inappropriateness**: The softmax function is actually appropriate for binary classification tasks when framed correctly (with two output nodes, each representing one class). Thus, the use of softmax is not intrinsically flawed for this task.

Considering the analysis above, the most likely reason for the described situation is overfitting due to the lack of dropout or other regularization methods, making option 4 the correct choice.
