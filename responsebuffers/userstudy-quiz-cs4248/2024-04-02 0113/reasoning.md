The described scenario where training loss decreases satisfactorily while validation loss stagnates is a classic sign of overfitting. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the specific details and noise in the training data to the extent that it negatively impacts the model's ability to generalize to unseen data. Regularization techniques like dropout help prevent overfitting by randomly "dropping out" neurons during the training process, which encourages the network to develop more robust features that generalize better. The absence of such techniques in this scenario likely led to the observed overfitting, explaining why the validation loss did not improve alongside the training loss.
