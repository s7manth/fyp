The deployment of LLMs, especially in critical areas like healthcare, demands a multi-faceted approach to responsibility and ethical considerations. The key aspect of deploying such technology responsibly is ensuring the safety and accuracy of the information it provides. This is particularly true for medical advice, where the consequences of inaccurate information can be severe. Involving medical professionals to oversee the model's output directly addresses the ethical need for accuracy, reliability, and accountability. It acknowledges that while LLMs can process and generate information at scale, the nuanced understanding and ethical judgment of human professionals are irreplaceable for sensitive applications. Moreover, this approach emphasizes the importance of human oversight in AI applications, aligning with broader ethical principles of accountability and harm reduction in AI deployment.
