The development and deployment of large language models (LLMs) powered by the transformer architecture have shown remarkable capabilities in generating human-like text, translation, and many other tasks. However, their widespread use has also raised concerns about potential harms and ethical considerations. Given a hypothetical scenario where a new LLM is being developed for generating medical advice based on symptoms described in natural language, which of the following considerations is the most critical to address before deploying such a model to ensure it aligns with ethical guidelines and minimizes potential harm?

1. Ensuring the model has been trained on a sufficiently large and diversified dataset to optimally perform across a wide range of medical conditions.
2. Implementing a mechanism for continuous learning so the model can update its knowledge base with the latest medical research and guidelines.
3. Establishing a robust filtering system to prevent the generation of content that could be considered harmful or offensive.
4. Involving medical professionals in the loop for validating and refining the modelâ€™s output before it is provided to end-users.
5. Developing a transparent model explanation framework that allows users to understand how the model arrived at a specific piece of advice.
