You are working on a sentiment analysis project focused on movie reviews. After training a logistic regression model using TF-IDF features, you decide to improve your model by incorporating word embeddings. You aim to compare the performance of TF-IDF features alone versus combining them with word embeddings derived from a Word2Vec model. Considering the properties of these two types of features, what is the most reasonable expectation regarding the potential impact on your modelâ€™s performance?

1. TF-IDF features will likely render word embeddings redundant because they both capture term frequency in a similar manner.
2. Word embeddings will improve the model significantly as they capture semantic relationships that TF-IDF does not, making the model more sensitive to nuanced expression in reviews.
3. Combining TF-IDF with word embeddings will likely worsen the model's performance due to the introduction of noise from the high dimensional space of word embeddings.
4. The impact of adding word embeddings to the TF-IDF features will solely depend on the dimensionality of the embeddings, with lower dimensions always leading to improved performance.
5. The combination of TF-IDF and word embeddings will not affect the model's performance, as logistic regression cannot effectively utilize the semantic information captured by embeddings.
