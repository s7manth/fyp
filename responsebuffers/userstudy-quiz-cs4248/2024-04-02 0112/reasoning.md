The reasoning behind the correct answer involves understanding the distinct but complementary nature of TF-IDF and word embeddings:

- **TF-IDF** offers a high-dimensional sparse representation that captures the importance of terms in documents but lacks any sense of semantics or word relationships. It's a more surface-level analysis of text data, focusing on frequency and ignoring context.

- **Word Embeddings** (specifically Word2Vec model outputs) are low-dimensional, dense, and designed to capture deep semantic relationships between words based on their context. They can highlight similarities and differences in meaning that are not apparent through simple term frequency analysis.

By combining TF-IDF with word embeddings, one can leverage the strengths of both approaches: the statistical weight of terms from TF-IDF and the nuanced understanding of language from word embeddings. This combination can result in a more robust model for sentiment analysis, which relies heavily on understanding the context and subtle differences in word usage to accurately gauge sentiment. Thus, while individually each method has its limitations, together they can potentially cover both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of text data, leading to significant improvements in model performance, especially in tasks requiring a deep understanding of language nuances, such as sentiment analysis.
