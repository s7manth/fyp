To determine the correct answer, it is necessary to understand the differences between token-based and span-based masking and how these strategies impact the learning capabilities of a model. Token-based masking (as used in BERT) involves randomly selecting individual tokens for masking, whereas span-based masking involves masking contiguous sequences of tokens. This approach encourages the model to infer the missing information based not just on the immediate context but also on a broader understanding of the sentence structure and meaning.

Options 1, 3, and 4 are incorrect because span-based masking does not directly impact computational complexity, dataset size, or memory requirements in the mentioned ways. These factors are more closely related to the implementation details of the model rather than the masking strategy.

Option 5 is incorrect because the alignment of pre-trained models with different neural network architectures is not directly affected by the choice of masking strategy. Whether token-based or span-based masking is used, the key factor in integrating pre-trained models with other architectures lies in the compatibility of their embeddings and overall design, not the masking approach per se.

Option 2 is correct because, by masking contiguous sequences of tokens rather than individual ones, span-based masking compels the model to leverage broader context in order to predict the missing spans. This encourages the learning of higher-order dependencies between tokens that might not be adjacent, thereby enhancing the model's ability to understand and generate coherent and contextually appropriate language.
