The practitioner's aim is to reduce the vocabulary size while maintaining the semantic integrity of the text, which is crucial for improving the performance of a text classification task.

- **Regular Expressions**: Useful for identifying specific patterns of text, such as dates, email addresses, or hashtags, which can be useful in text normalization. However, on their own, they do not specifically address the morphological variation of words.
- **Text Normalization**: Involves processes like lowercasing, removing punctuation, and correcting misspellings, which can help in reducing the vocabulary size but does not directly handle the morphological variations of words.
- **Sentence Segmentation**: The process of converting a text into sentences. While essential for many NLP tasks, it does not contribute to vocabulary reduction in the context of morphological variation.
- **Stemming**: Reduces words to their base or root form, often crudely by chopping off the ends of words. This directly contributes to reducing the vocabulary size by consolidating words with the same root but does so at the risk of losing some semantic integrity (e.g., "operation", "operational", and "operating" might all be reduced to "operat").
- **Lemmatization**: This also reduces words to a base form but does so by considering the vocabulary and morphological analysis of the words, leading to the base or dictionary form of a word (lemma). This ensures that the root word belongs to the language and typically preserves semantic integrity more effectively than stemming.

Given these tools, the combination of **Lemmatization and Text Normalization** is the most effective for reducing vocabulary size while also maintaining the semantic integrity of the text. Lemmatization deals with morphological variation by reducing words to their lemma, which helps in decreasing the vocabulary. Text normalization further reduces the vocabulary size by standardizing the text (e.g., lowercasing, removing punctuation), making it easier for the classification algorithms to process.
