To determine the most likely impact of employing span-based masking during the pre-training of a bidirectional transformer encoder for a text summarization task, let us analyze each option’s implications on the model's learning dynamics and the specific requirements of text summarization.

- Option 1 suggests a reduction in training time. However, span-based masking, while it offers a more complex and rich training signal by hiding spans of text rather than individual tokens, does not inherently streamline processing in a way that would reduce overall training time. In fact, handling spans might introduce additional computational overhead, making this option unlikely.

- Option 2 posits that span-based masking will improve the model's grasp of contextual dependencies across longer text spans, which is crucial for generating coherent summaries. By training the model to predict missing text spans rather than individual tokens, it gains a finer understanding of the text's overall structure and meaning, which is essential for summarization that involves condensing and coherently restructuring information.

- Option 3 suggests benefits limited to token-level tasks like named entity recognition. While it's true that span-based masking can enhance performance on a variety of NLP tasks, its value is not limited to token-level tasks. The coherent merging and understanding of information across spans can significantly impact tasks that involve more extensive text manipulation, like summarization.

- Option 4 concerns about degradation in performance due to increased complexity. While more complex training objectives can sometimes make learning more challenging, the sophisticated nature of bidirectional transformer models allows them to benefit from the richer context provided by span-based masking, making this outcome less likely.

- Option 5 discusses model size and memory requirements without addressing improvements in summarization capabilities. While more complex tasks can potentially increase model size and memory needs, the primary aim of span-based masking—one of enhancing model's understanding—is not directly related to size but to the model's capability to process and infer from more extensive contexts, thus, making this option not directly relevant.

Based on these analyses, option 2 is the most plausible, as span-based masking genuinely enhances the model's ability to understand longer contextual dependencies, which is a critical capability for effective text summarization.
