The specific incorrectness of statement 4 lies in a misunderstanding of how the step size (learning rate) affects the gradient descent optimization process. In gradient descent, smaller step sizes slow down the convergence because the updates to the weights are smaller, meaning the algorithm makes more cautious, incremental progress towards minimizing the loss function. This cautious approach can be beneficial in terms of achieving stable convergence, especially in complex loss landscapes, but it does not accelerate the process. Rather, it ensures that the optimization does not miss or overshoot the global minimum by making overly large steps based on gradient estimations. This detailed analysis highlights the importance of understanding the nuances of optimization techniques and their impact on machine learning model training and performance.
