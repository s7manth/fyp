Decreasing the threshold for classifying a review as positive is most likely to increase the recall for the positive class because it allows more true positive reviews to be correctly classified as such, albeit at the potential expense of increasing false positives and thus possibly reducing precision. However, since the goal is to improve the F1 score, which benefits from balancing precision and recall, and considering our current precision (PP) is higher than recall (RP), enhancing recall even at the cost of precision is a strategic decision. This choice best fits the requirement to potentially increase the F1 score for the positive class, given the information provided.
