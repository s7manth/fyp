Suppose you are building a Naive Bayes sentiment analysis model to classify movie reviews into positive or negative categories. After training your model on a balanced dataset, you evaluate its performance on a test set and observe the following:

- Precision for Positive Class (PP): 0.8
- Recall for Positive Class (RP): 0.7
- Precision for Negative Class (PN): 0.6
- Recall for Negative Class (RN): 0.9

You are considering making adjustments to improve your model’s performance. Which of the following actions is most likely to increase the F1 score for the positive class, without necessarily maintaining or improving the model’s performance for the negative class?

1. Increase the threshold for classifying a review as positive.
2. Decrease the threshold for classifying a review as positive.
3. Train the model on a larger dataset with more examples of positive reviews.
4. Apply feature selection to remove noisy or irrelevant features.
5. Utilize a more complex model that leverages contextual embeddings.
