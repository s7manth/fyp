A research team is developing an NLP system aimed at enhancing the accuracy of Named Entity Recognition (NER) in biomedical texts, where accurately identifying and classifying biomedical entities (such as diseases, drugs, and proteins) is crucial. Given the complex nature of these texts, the team decided to employ Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) due to their ability to capture both the lexical features of the words and the context in which they appear. They are now in the phase of feature engineering to improve the performance of their CRF model.

Which of the following feature sets would likely be MOST effective for improving the performance of the CRF model for NER in biomedical texts?

1. The word itself, part-of-speech tags of neighboring words, and presence of numbers.
2. The word itself, part-of-speech tags of neighboring words, and the genre of the text (e.g., research article, review article).
3. The word itself, the orthographic features (e.g., capitalization, presence of dashes), and the surrounding bi-grams.
4. The word itself, the orthographic features (e.g., capitalization, presence of dashes), and the presence of specific amino acid sequences.
5. The frequency of the word in the corpus, the semantic similarity of the word to key biomedical terms, and the length of the word.
