Named Entity Recognition in specialized domains like the biomedical field benefits significantly from features that capture both lexical characteristics and contextual information. The word itself is essential for direct identification, orthographic features are especially indicative in this domain (many biomedical terms have unique spellings or contain special characters like dashes), and the contextual information provided by surrounding bi-grams helps in understanding the context in which a term is used. This combination of features is effective in addressing the complexity and specificity of biomedical texts, thus enhancing the performance of the CRF model for NER tasks within this domain.
