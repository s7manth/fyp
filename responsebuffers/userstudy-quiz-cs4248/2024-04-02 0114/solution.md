To correctly answer this question, one needs to understand the challenges associated with training neural networks for NLP and how different optimizations and modifications of the basic gradient descent algorithm address these challenges.

1. **Gradient Descent and Local Minima**: While it's true that SGD introduces randomness that can help escape local minima, the perception that neural networks with many layers suffer significantly from local minima is somewhat outdated. Modern understanding suggests that saddle points, not local minima, pose a bigger issue in high-dimensional spaces. However, the introduction of randomness indeed helps navigate the loss landscape more effectively.

2. **Adaptive Learning Rates**: Adam and other adaptive learning rate algorithms (e.g., RMSprop, Adagrad) adjust the learning rate based on past gradients. This can significantly help in NLP applications where the sparse and uneven distribution of features can lead to uneven parameter updates. Adam adjusts learning rates based on the estimated moments of gradients, improving efficiency over standard SGD.

3. **Mini-batch Gradient Descent**: This option directly addresses the computational issue with large datasets. By computing gradients on small subsets (batches) of data, mini-batch gradient descent offers a balance between the efficiency of SGD and the stability of batch gradient descent, making it suitable for large datasets common in NLP tasks.

4. **Vanishing Gradient Problem**: The vanishing gradient problem is a significant challenge in training deep neural networks, affecting the network's ability to learn long-range dependencies. However, L2 regularization does not address this problem directly. Techniques such as using different activation functions (e.g., ReLU), careful initialization methods, and architectures like LSTM or GRU cells are more directly related to addressing the vanishing gradient problem.

5. **Contrastive Divergence**: While contrastive divergence is an optimization algorithm, it's more commonly associated with training models like Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) and not typically used in the context of gradient descent for NLP tasks. The statement about bias towards frequent features relates more to strategies like feature normalization or rare word handling techniques in NLP.

Given the options, **3. In large datasets typical of NLP tasks, computing the gradient over the whole dataset can be computationally expensive; mini-batch gradient descent mitigates this by approximating the gradient over smaller subsets of the data, which accelerates convergence.** directly addresses a recognized issue in NLP and offers a practical solution widely used in the field.
