The Encoder-Decoder architecture is most suitable for summarizing long documents because it is specifically designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks. The use of LSTM units in both the encoder and decoder allows the model to effectively capture and utilize long-term dependencies in the text, which is crucial for understanding the overall context and generating coherent summaries. This architecture can compress the information from the entire input document into a context vector, which the decoder then uses to produce a summary. The capability to deal with lengthy inputs and produce meaningful outputs by comprehending the entire sequence context makes the Encoder-Decoder model with LSTM the best choice among the given options for the document summarization system. The choice also considers the limitations of simple RNNs, bidirectional LSTMs without sequence-to-sequence framework, and the inapplicability of CNNs for this task.
