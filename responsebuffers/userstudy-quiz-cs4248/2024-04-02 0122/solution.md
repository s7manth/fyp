To tackle the problem of summarizing long documents, the neural network architecture needs to be capable of understanding and processing sequences (the sentences in the documents) and then generating another sequence (the summary). The architecture must be efficient in handling long dependencies to grasp the context and the essence of the lengthy documents, which can be challenging due to the vanishing gradient problem intrinsic to RNNs.

1. **A simple RNN with a single hidden layer** would struggle with learning dependencies between words occurring far apart in the text due to the vanishing gradient problem, making it unsuitable for summarizing long documents accurately.

2. **A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network with multiple layers** enhances the model's ability to learn long-term dependencies compared to simple RNNs. LSTMs are specifically designed to address the vanishing gradient problem, making them more suitable for tasks involving long sequences, like summarization. However, they process data in a unidirectional manner, which may not be optimal for understanding the full context of the text.

3. **A bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) without any additional modifications** processes data in both directions, offering a more comprehensive understanding of the context. While BiLSTMs provide a better grasp of context compared to unidirectional LSTMs, they are still not explicitly designed for the summarization task which involves sequence to sequence processing.

4. **An Encoder-Decoder model with LSTM as both encoder and decoder units** is specifically designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks like machine translation, text summarization, etc. The encoder captures the context of the entire document and encodes it into a fixed-length vector from which the decoder generates the summary. This architecture combines the advantages of LSTMs in handling long dependencies with a structure tailored for summarization tasks.

5. **A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed for image recognition tasks** is not suited for generating text summaries as CNNs predominantly excel in applications involving spatial hierarchies and patterns within data such as images, not sequential data processing or generation which is required for text summarization.

Therefore, **an Encoder-Decoder model with LSTM as both encoder and decoder units** is most appropriate for this task due to its capacity for handling long sequences and its design for transforming one sequence into another, which aligns well with the requirements of a document summarization system.
