Given a scenario where you are designing an NLP system to automatically summarize long documents into concise, informative abstracts, which of the following neural network architectures would be most appropriate to use, and why?

1. A simple Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with a single hidden layer.
2. A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network with multiple layers.
3. A bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) without any additional modifications.
4. An Encoder-Decoder model with LSTM as both encoder and decoder units.
5. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed for image recognition tasks.
