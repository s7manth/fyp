The rationale behind choosing TF-IDF over the other options is founded on its ability to highlight words that are uniquely relevant to certain documents (user reviews, in this case) by considering not just the word's frequency in individual documents (TF) but also how commonly or uncommonly it appears across all documents (IDF). Unlike Cosine Similarity, which is a measure of similarity between two vectors, or the Word2Vec Skip-Gram model, which captures contextual information but does not inherently weigh word importance based on their occurrence across documents, TF-IDF directly addresses the need to balance the frequency of words with their informativeness across a corpus. PMI, while useful for analyzing word co-occurrences, does not capture the unique importance of words in the context of their document frequency across a larger corpus. Hence, for diminishing the influence of common, less informative words and highlighting unique, informative ones, TF-IDF is the most appropriate technique.
