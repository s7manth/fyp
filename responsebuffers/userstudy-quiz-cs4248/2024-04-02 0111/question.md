You are developing a sentiment analysis model to understand user reviews on various tech products. Your approach utilizes word embeddings to convert words into vectors for processing. For feature selection, you decide to enhance your model by diminishing the influence of common but less informative words across documents, while highlighting unique, informative ones within specific documents. Which of the following techniques best fits your requirement to adjust the word vectors accordingly?

1. Applying Cosine Similarity on the word vectors to reduce dimensionality.
2. Employing Term Frequency (TF) to emphasize the recurrence of words in documents.
3. Utilizing Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) to weigh words' importance.
4. Leveraging Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) to measure word co-occurrences significantly.
5. Implementing Word2Vec Skip-Gram model to capture contextual information for each word.
