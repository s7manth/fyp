To enhance the sentiment analysis model by diminishing the influence of common but less informative words across documents while emphasizing unique, informative ones within specific documents, the best approach is to utilize the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) technique.

**Step-by-step approach:**

1. **Term Frequency (TF)**: Calculates how frequently a term occurs in a document. While useful, it does not consider the importance of a word across multiple documents.

2. **Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)**: This metric evaluates how important a word is across a set of documents. It diminishes the weight of terms that occur very frequently across the documents and increases the weight of terms that occur rarely.

3. **TF-IDF**: By combining TF and IDF, this technique weighs the frequency of words occurring in a document against the inverse document frequency of the word across a set of documents. This helps in identifying words that are unique and informative to specific documents (in this case, user reviews) by penalizing common words across all documents and promoting terms that are particularly unique to a document.

4. **Applying TF-IDF in sentiment analysis**: When applied to the word vectors in sentiment analysis, the TF-IDF technique adjusted the feature space so that it emphasizes words that are pivotal in determining sentiment unique to specific products, while diminishing the impact of common, less informative words. This nuanced weighting can significantly improve the performance of the model by focusing on the most discriminative terms.
