Kneser-Ney smoothing is particularly effective in handling data sparsity and unseen N-grams within specialized domains due to its intelligent approach to probability distribution. By focusing on the distinctiveness of the contexts in which words appear, Kneser-Ney smoothing can more accurately model the likelihood of new, unseen N-grams. This effectiveness is attributed to its methodology of discounting seen N-grams' probabilities and allocating that probability mass to unseen N-grams based on the contexts they might appear in, rather than simply their frequency. This approach is superior in scenarios where there is a need to generate plausible, contextually relevant text despite the data sparsity challenge, as is the case with sampling sentences from language models in specialized domains.
