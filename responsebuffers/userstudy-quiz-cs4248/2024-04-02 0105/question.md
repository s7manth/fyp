Considering the challenges in natural language processing (NLP) concerning the evaluation of language models, particularly when dealing with rare or unseen words, a certain level of creativity in smoothing techniques is required for better model performance. Given this background, imagine you are working on an N-gram language model for a text generation task that involves sampling sentences from a highly specialized domain with a limited dataset. You decide to evaluate different smoothing techniques to tackle the issue of data sparsity. Among the following smoothing techniques, which would be the most effective in mitigating the effects of data sparsity while ensuring that the model does not assign zero probabilities to unseen N-grams, thereby facilitating more robust sentence sampling?

1. Add-one (Laplace) smoothing
2. Good-Turing discounting
3. Linear interpolation smoothing
4. Kneser-Ney smoothing
5. Absolute discounting
