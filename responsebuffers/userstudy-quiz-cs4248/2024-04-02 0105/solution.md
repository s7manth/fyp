To solve this problem, let's evaluate each of the given choices based on the challenges mentioned: mitigating effects of data sparsity and preventing zero probabilities for unseen N-grams:

1. **Add-one (Laplace) smoothing** is a simple technique where one is added to each count. However, it tends to overestimate the probability of unseen events, which can be particularly problematic in specialized domains due to the distribution of technical terms.
2. **Good-Turing discounting** adjusts the counts of observed and unseen events based on the observed frequencies. It can be useful, but it may not always be the best at handling the data sparsity in domain-specific datasets since it does not specifically account for the context of N-grams.
3. **Linear interpolation smoothing** combines the probabilities from different N-gram models (e.g., unigram, bigram, trigram) weighted by coefficients that are usually learned from a held-out dataset. It can account for unseen N-grams by leveraging information from lower-order N-grams. However, its effectiveness heavily relies on the chosen coefficients and may not inherently prioritize the more specific contextual relationships in specialized domains.
4. **Kneser-Ney smoothing** uniquely addresses the issue of data sparsity by discounting the probability of seen N-grams and redistributing this probability mass to unseen N-grams based on their context. It does this through modeling the distinctiveness of word histories, which is particularly useful in specialized domains where the introduction of new terms may share contexts with known terms, thus allowing for more meaningful generalizations about unseen data.
5. **Absolute discounting** reduces the probability of seen N-grams by a fixed amount and redistributes it among unseen N-grams. While it addresses zero probabilities, it does not do so as effectively in specialized domains as techniques that more intricately analyze the context and distribution of terms.

Considering the criteria of mitigating data sparsity and zero probabilities for unseen N-grams, especially in a specialized domain, **Kneser-Ney smoothing** uniquely stands out due to its sophisticated approach to redistributing probabilities based on context, making it the most effective choice for the given scenario.
