Option 3 is most likely to improve the system's translation accuracy because attention mechanisms provide a dynamic way for the model to weigh the importance of various parts of the input sentence during translation. This is particularly useful in sequence-to-sequence tasks like translation, where each word in the output sequence might relate more closely to specific words in the input sequence rather than the entire sequence equally. By allowing both the encoder and decoder to pay "attention" to the most relevant parts of the input at each step in the translation process, the model can produce more accurate and contextually appropriate translations. This approach directly addresses the critical challenge of capturing the semantic meaning in the encoder and effectively utilizing that information in the decoder, thereby enhancing overall translation quality.
