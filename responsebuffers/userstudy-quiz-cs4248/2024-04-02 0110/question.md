A machine learning engineer is developing a logistic regression model to predict whether emails are spam or not spam. After training the model, they decide to enhance the model's generalization capabilities by introducing regularization. Which of the following statements best explains the impact of applying L2 regularization to the logistic regression model's learning process?

1. L2 regularization will convert the logistic regression into a linear regression model to handle the spam classification problem more effectively.
2. By applying L2 regularization, the model will be constrained to learn with polynomial features to capture non-linear relationships in the email data.
3. L2 regularization will encourage the model weights to be exactly zero, which is useful for feature selection and reducing model complexity.
4. L2 regularization adds a penalty to the size of the weights, encouraging smaller, more diffuse weight values, which helps in reducing overfitting.
5. L2 regularization specifically modifies the logistic regression's sigmoid function to be more steep, allowing for sharper decision boundaries between spam and not spam.
