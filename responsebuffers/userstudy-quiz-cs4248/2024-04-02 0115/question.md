You are developing a new large language model (LLM) based on the Transformer architecture for generating news articles. During training, you notice that the model is excellent at retaining factual accuracy but struggles with maintaining a coherent narrative throughout the text. Implementing a solution to improve narrative coherence without significantly impacting the model's factual accuracy involves adjusting various components of the Transformer architecture and training process. Which of the following approaches is most likely to improve the narrative coherence of the generated news articles?

1. Increase the size of the attention heads to capture more nuanced relationships between words.
2. Incorporate an additional loss function that penalizes narrative incoherence directly, using an external coherence evaluation metric.
3. Decrease the size of the embedding layer to reduce the model's complexity and focus on learning narrative structures.
4. Train the model with a larger dataset of news articles that have been specially annotated for narrative coherence.
5. Adjust the temperature parameter in the softmax function during sampling to generate text with higher unpredictability, enhancing creative narration.
