- **Option 1:** Increasing the size of the attention heads can help the model capture more nuanced relationships between words. However, this primarily enhances the model's ability to understand detailed relationships and does not directly address the issue of overall narrative coherence. 

- **Option 2:** Directly targeting the problem by incorporating a loss function focused on narrative coherence is the most direct and effective approach. It utilizes an external metric designed to evaluate narrative coherence, guiding the model to generate more coherent stories while still maintaining factual accuracy.

- **Option 3:** Decreasing the size of the embedding layer could potentially reduce the modelâ€™s expressive power and its ability to learn complex representations of words and their nuances. This might adversely affect both factual accuracy and narrative coherence, making it counterproductive.

- **Option 4:** Training with a larger dataset that has been annotated for narrative coherence could indeed improve the model's performance in generating coherent narratives. However, the feasibility and availability of such specially annotated datasets can be a significant challenge. Moreover, without adjusting the model's objective function or loss to directly account for narrative coherence, the benefits may not be fully realized.

- **Option 5:** Adjusting the temperature parameter during sampling affects the randomness and unpredictability of the generated text. While higher unpredictability could introduce more variance and creativity, it does not necessarily ensure that the generated narratives will be coherent. In fact, increasing unpredictability without a targeted strategy for enhancing coherence could exacerbate the issue.
