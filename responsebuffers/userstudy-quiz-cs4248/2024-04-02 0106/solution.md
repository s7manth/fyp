The key factors affecting the choice of language model and smoothing technique are the diversity of the dataset, the real-time prediction requirement, and limited hardware resources. 

- **A unigram model with Laplace smoothing** is simple and requires less computational resources but is too primitive for diverse datasets and real-time prediction because it doesn't capture the context effectively.
- **A bigram model with Good-Turing smoothing** improves over unigram models by considering pairwise context, and Good-Turing smoothing helps with unseen bigrams. However, it might not balance the diversity efficiently due to its limited context.
- **A trigram model with Kneser-Ney smoothing** strikes a better balance between capturing enough contextual information and computational efficiency. Kneser-Ney smoothing is particularly effective in handling zero probabilities for unseen contexts in diverse datasets.
- **A quadrigram model without any smoothing** would potentially offer good prediction quality due to capturing a wider context but would suffer significantly in scenarios where the exact quadrigram hasn't been seen before, making it impractical for real-time predictions and devices with limited hardware resources.
- **A 5-gram model with Stupid Backoff** increases context size further, which could theoretically improve accuracy but at the expense of significantly greater computational and memory requirements. Stupid Backoff is a simpler technique that does not probabilistically normalize unseen N-grams, making it less accurate than other smoothing methods.

Considering efficiency, accuracy, and the ability to deal with dataset diversity, the best choice is **a trigram model with Kneser-Ney smoothing** because it provides a good balance by capturing more context than unigrams and bigrams while still being computationally feasible for real-time predictions on devices with limited hardware resources. Kneser-Ney smoothing is adept at handling the zero-probability issue for unseen N-grams, which is crucial for a diverse dataset.
