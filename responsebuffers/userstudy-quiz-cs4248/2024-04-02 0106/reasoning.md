The reasoning lies in the need to balance the model's size and complexity with the prediction quality. A trigram model, which considers the two previous words to predict the next word, provides a reasonable compromise between capturing enough contextual information for accurate prediction and maintaining computational efficiency. This is crucial for a mobile keyboard app that operates in real-time and on devices with limited computational capacity. Kneser-Ney smoothing is chosen because it is superior at dealing with zero probabilities for unseen N-grams without significantly increasing the model size, making it ideal for diverse datasets where encountering unseen word combinations is likely. This choice offers the best balance for the stated requirements of efficiency, prediction quality, and handling a diverse dataset.
