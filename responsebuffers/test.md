## Question
Given the definitions and concepts outlined in the provided textbook content, which of the following statements best illustrates the concept of "structural ambiguity" in the context of natural language processing and context-free grammars (CFGs)?

1. Structural ambiguity occurs when a grammar cannot generate any string of terminal symbols from the start symbol.
2. It happens when a single string of terminal symbols can be derived using different sequences of rule applications, leading to multiple possible parse trees.
3. Structural ambiguity arises solely from the limitations of the CKY algorithm when parsing sentences in natural language.
4. It is the result of having too many non-terminal symbols in a CFG, leading to unclear derivation paths for strings.
5. Structural ambiguity is related to the inability of a context-free grammar to be converted into Chomsky Normal Form (CNF).

## Solution
The correct answer is: 2. It happens when a single string of terminal symbols can be derived using different sequences of rule applications, leading to multiple possible parse trees.

## Reasoning
Structural ambiguity in natural language processing refers to the phenomenon where a single sequence of words (a string of terminal symbols) can be assigned more than one syntactic structure or interpretation. This ambiguity is significant because it impacts how sentences are parsed and understood by both humans and computational systems. In the context of context-free grammars (CFGs), this ambiguity manifests when a single string of terminal symbols can be derived from the start symbol through different sequences of rule applications, potentially resulting in multiple valid parse trees for the same sentence. This is directly related to the concept mentioned in Context 2, which highlights that structural ambiguity presents a significant challenge for parsers, because it complicates the process of determining the correct syntactic structure of sentences.

Choices 1, 3, 4, and 5 do not accurately represent the concept of structural ambiguity as defined in the provided contexts. Specifically:
- Choice 1 is incorrect because structural ambiguity is not about the inability to generate strings but about generating the same string in multiple ways.
- Choice 3 is incorrect because structural ambiguity exists independently of any specific parsing algorithm, such as the CKY algorithm.
- Choice 4 misinterprets the source of ambiguity; it is not the number of non-terminal symbols that causes structural ambiguity but the nature of the grammar rules and their applications.
- Choice 5 is incorrect because structural ambiguity is a property of the language or grammar itself, not a result of conversion processes like converting a CFG into CNF.

Therefore, option 2 is the best representation of structural ambiguity as it aligns with the definitions and implications discussed in the provided textbook content, particularly emphasizing the challenges it poses for syntactic parsing and interpretation within the framework of context-free grammars.
