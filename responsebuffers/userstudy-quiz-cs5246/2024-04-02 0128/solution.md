To efficiently extract the relationships between common adjectives and the nouns they describe, the appropriate technique is dependency parsing. This choice is guided by several key considerations:

- **Dependency Parsing**: This approach is specifically designed to analyze the grammatical structure of sentences and establish relationships between "head" words and words which modify those heads. In the context of extracting adjective-noun relationships, dependency parsers can directly identify which adjectives (modifiers) are connected to which nouns. This direct relationship extraction makes dependency parsing uniquely suited for the researcher's objective of understanding specific adjectives' relations to nouns.
  
- **Constituency Parsing**: While useful for breaking down sentences into their constituent parts (phrases/clauses), constituency parsing does not directly provide the specific modifier-noun relationships with the same precision or ease as dependency parsing. It's primarily concerned with the sentence's hierarchical structure, which isn't as directly helpful for linking adjectives and nouns.
  
- **WordNet**: While an invaluable resource for exploring word meanings, synonyms, antonyms, and more, WordNet is less about parsing individual sentences and more about understanding words in isolation or their relationships to other words in a broader linguistics context. It doesn't directly facilitate the extraction of adjective-noun pairs from sentences.
  
- **N-gram Models**: N-gram models capture sequences of words but without understanding of their grammatical relationships. While n-grams could highlight frequently occurring adjective-noun pairs, they lack the precision in identifying the dependency relationship; many occurrences could be coincidental or not directly descriptive.
  
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Focusing on sentiment analysis for entire reviews can provide a general sentiment score but fails to extract the finer details of which specific adjectives describe which nouns, thus missing the researcher's target objective.

Therefore, dependency parsing is the most suitable technique for extracting the precise relationships between adjectives and nouns in customer reviews, as it analyzes the grammatical structure to establish direct connections between words based on their roles in sentences.
