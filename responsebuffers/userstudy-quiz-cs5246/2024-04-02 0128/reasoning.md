Dependency parsing is ideal for the researcher's goal due to its focus on the grammatical relationships between words in a sentence. Unlike constituency parsing, which segments sentences into sub-phrases without directly highlighting the modifier-head (adjective-noun) relationship, dependency parsing creates links between words based on their syntactic roles. This allows for the direct extraction of pairs where adjectives describe nouns, facilitating an analysis on how specific product features (nouns) are perceived (as described by adjectives). This task requires understanding the grammatical structure and dependencies, something dependency parsing specializes in, making it the most suitable technique for this context.
