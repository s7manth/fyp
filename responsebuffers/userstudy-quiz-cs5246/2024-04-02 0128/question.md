A researcher is analyzing customer reviews of electronic gadgets from an online store to understand common issues faced by customers and assess overall sentiment. The researcher decides to use text mining techniques to automate the process but is uncertain about which approach to apply for best extracting the relationships between common adjectives and the nouns they describe in sentences, such as identifying that "durable" typically describes "battery" in positive reviews. Considering the tools and methods taught in this course, which technique would be most appropriate for this task?

1. Applying WordNet to extract hypernym/hyponym pairs from reviews
2. Using constituency parsing to identify noun phrases and their adjectives
3. Utilizing dependency parsing to extract adjective-noun dependencies
4. Employing n-gram models to capture common sequences of words
5. Implementing sentiment analysis on entire reviews without focusing on specific word relationships
