Given a sentence, "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog", you are tasked with analyzing its structure using both Constituency Parsing and Dependency Parsing techniques. Keeping in mind the principles of these parsing methods and the fundamental differences between them, which of the following statements accurately captures a scenario you would expect in your analysis?

1. Constituency Parsing would reveal that "quick brown fox" forms a compound noun, while Dependency Parsing would not indicate any relationship between these words.
2. Dependency Parsing would identify "jumped" as the root of the sentence, whereas Constituency Parsing would show it as part of a larger noun phrase.
3. Constituency Parsing would organize the sentence into a tree structure based on syntactic categories, while Dependency Parsing would illustrate the grammatical relations and dependencies between words.
4. In Dependency Parsing, "lazy" would be marked as a dependent of "The", indicating determiner-noun relation, unlike in Constituency Parsing.
5. Constituency Parsing would highlight "over the lazy dog" as a prepositional phrase acting independently of the sentence, without showing its relation to "jumped".
