The correct answer best encapsulates the fundamental approaches of Constituency and Dependency Parsing without conflating their methodologies or outcomes. Constituency Parsing is about identifying the sub-structures (syntactic categories) within sentences, laying out a hierarchical tree structure. On the other hand, Dependency Parsing concerns itself with how words in a sentence are related to each other, marking grammatical dependencies and illustrating them through a network of nodes (words) and edges (relationships). Through understanding these core principles, we can accurately determine how each method would analyze the sentence in question, making Option 3 the best choice that reflects the practical applications and theoretical underpinnings of both parsing techniques.
