For the given sentence, "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog":
- Constituency Parsing would illustrate how the sentence is divided into its syntactic componentsâ€”NP, VP, and PP among others. "The quick brown fox" would be shown as a Noun Phrase (NP).
- Dependency Parsing would indeed identify "jumped" as the root because it is the main action from which other parts of the sentence depend. It would show how "the quick brown fox" acts as the subject of "jumped" and how "over the lazy dog" describes where the jumping occurred.

1. Incorrect. Constituency Parsing identifies parts of the sentence as syntactic categories, such as NP for "quick brown fox". Dependency Parsing shows relationships and would indeed highlight relations among these words, identifying their dependencies.
2. Incorrect. "Jumped" is identified as the root in Dependency Parsing, but Constituency Parsing would not classify it as part of a noun phrase; it's part of a Verb Phrase (VP).
3. Correct. This statement accurately reflects the principles of both parsing methods, showing the structural approach of Constituency Parsing and the relational approach of Dependency Parsing.
4. Incorrect. Dependency Parsing does not mark "lazy" as dependent on "The". "Lazy" would be a modifier of "dog", and "The" can be a determiner for "dog" or the whole noun phrase but not in the way described.
5. Incorrect. Both parsing strategies show the phrase's relation to the rest of the sentence, especially how the prepositional phrase "over the lazy dog" relates to the verb "jumped".
