Dependency parsing is the technique that aims at uncovering the structure of a sentence by establishing relationships between "head" words and words which modify those heads. In the sentence "The cat sat on the mat," dependency parsing correctly identifies the action or verb "sat" as the central node of the sentence from which the structure is built. It identifies "cat" as the doer of the action (subject) and "the mat" as where the action is performed (location), with "on" serving as a preposition that links the verb to its location. This accurately captures both the sentence structure and the semantic relationships within it, such as who is performing the action and where the action is taking place, which is central to understanding the sentence's meaning.
