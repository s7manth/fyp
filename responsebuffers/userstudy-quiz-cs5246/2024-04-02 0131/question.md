You are analyzing the sentence "The cat sat on the mat", and you aim to extract structured information using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Considering the sentence's structure and semantics, which of the following statements is most accurate in highlighting the correct approach and outcome of analyzing this sentence?

1. Dependency parsing will identify "cat" and "mat" as the core nouns of the sentence, with "sat" acting merely as a linking verb without much semantic weight.
2. Constituency parsing will divide the sentence into a binary tree, focusing exclusively on the syntactic categories like NP (Noun Phrase) and VP (Verb Phrase) without giving insights into the relationships between "cat" and "mat".
3. WordNet can be used to identify that "cat" and "mat" are nouns with a hyponym-hypernym relationship, indicating a hierarchical structure in their meanings.
4. Using dependency parsing, we can identify "sat" as the root of the sentence, with edges pointing to "cat" (subject) and "mat" (location), thus highlighting the action and the participants.
5. Constituency parsing will identify "the cat" and "the mat" as sibling nodes in the parse tree, suggesting a direct action or interaction between these two entities.
