When classifying text documents such as news articles, the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm typically works by finding a predefined number (K) of training samples closest in distance to the new point and predicting the label from these. The distance can be calculated in various ways, which is critical to understanding the correct choice:

- **Euclidean Distance**: It measures the straight line distance between two points in Euclidean space. While it's a common method, for high-dimensional data like text, Euclidean distance becomes less effective due to the curse of dimensionality.

- **Cosine Similarity**: Instead of calculating a direct distance, cosine similarity measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors. This measure is particularly suitable for text data since it effectively captures the orientation (i.e., direction) similarity between documents, regardless of their size. This characteristic aligns well with procedures like TF-IDF vectorization, which turns text into high-dimensional vectors and illustrates why cosine similarity is preferred for text classification. 

- **Jaccard Similarity**: Primarily used for sets, it measures similarity by dividing the size of the intersection by the size of the union of two sets of items. While applicable to text, especially on a binary scale (e.g., presence or absence of words), it isn't as nuanced as cosine similarity in capturing textual nuances in vectorized forms.

The process described in choice 4 — calculating the cosine similarity between the new article and every article in the training set, then selecting the K articles with the highest similarity scores — best fits the scenario of classifying text documents. It leverages the strength of cosine similarity in handling high-dimensional, sparse data sets typical in text mining tasks.

Choice 1 using Euclidean distance, while plausible, is not as effective in high-dimensional spaces like those created after TF-IDF vectorization. Choice 2 and choice 5 address the method of predicting the label (majority voting) but are paired with distance measures that aren't as suitable for text data as cosine similarity. Choice 3 involves averaging vectors, which isn't a standard approach in KNN classification where the decision is typically made based on majority voting among the K nearest neighbors rather than averaging their features.
