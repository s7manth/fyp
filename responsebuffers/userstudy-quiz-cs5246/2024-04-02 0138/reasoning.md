This option is correct because it focuses on the key aspect of text mining tasks where documents are represented in high-dimensional spaces, and similarity measures that account for the directionality (or orientation) of the text vectors, rather than their magnitude, are more effective. The cosine similarity captures this aspect by measuring the cosine of the angle between two vectors, making it particularly suitable for comparing documents in sentiment analysis and other text classification tasks. This choice mirrors the practical considerations that must guide the configuration of the KNN algorithm for text mining, balancing theoretical insights with the specific requirements of working with high-dimensional textual data.
