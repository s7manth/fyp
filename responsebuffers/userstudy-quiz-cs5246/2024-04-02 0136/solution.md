To solve the split vote situation in a KNN classification task using cosine similarity, one needs to understand the behavior of KNN and the effect of similarity measures on classification. KNN classifies a test instance based on the majority vote of its 'k' nearest neighbors. When a tie occurs, it indicates that an equal number of neighbors belong to each category, leading to ambiguity in the decision.

The best way to deal with this issue is highlighted in option 2 - implementing a weighted voting system where closer neighbors have more influence on the classification decision than farther ones. This approach leverages the distances or similarity scores that are intrinsic to the KNN algorithm, assigning more weight to closer neighbors on the assumption that they are more likely to be in the same class as the test instance.

Option 1 suggests adjusting 'k' to be an even number, which is incorrect as having an even 'k' can actually lead to more ties. An odd value of 'k' is generally preferred to avoid ties, but this does not directly address the issue of a split vote.

Option 3 involves increasing dimensionality which might not necessarily help and could even worsen the situation by introducing the 'curse of dimensionality', where increasing the feature space without sufficient data can lead to sparsity and reduced model performance.

Option 4 proposes switching the similarity measure to Euclidean distance. While different similarity measures have their own merits, simply changing from cosine similarity to Euclidean distance without a specific rationale does not inherently solve the problem of tie votes.

Option 5 suggests applying dimensionality reduction techniques. While such techniques can sometimes improve separability and model performance by removing irrelevant features, they do not offer a direct solution to resolving a tie in the voting process of a KNN classifier.
