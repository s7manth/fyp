In a recent project on natural language processing (NLP), an NLP engineer is tasked with classifying customer feedback into one of two categories: Positive or Negative. They decide to employ the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for this classification task. They plan to use the cosine similarity measure to identify the 'k' most similar training documents to a given test document. When processing a new piece of customer feedback (i.e., a test instance), the engineer observes a split vote among the 'k' nearest neighbors with an equal number of neighbors voting for both Positive and Negative categories.

Which adjustment to the KNN classification process could BEST resolve this split vote situation, ensuring a definitive classification for the test instance?

1. Adjust the value of 'k' to be either larger or smaller, ensuring it is an even number to avoid tie votes.
2. Implement a weighted voting system where closer neighbors have more influence on the classification decision than farther ones.
3. Increase the dimensionality of the feature space by including more descriptive words in the vocabulary.
4. Utilize a different similarity measure, such as Euclidean distance, instead of cosine similarity.
5. Apply dimensionality reduction techniques, such as PCA, to improve the separability of the Positive and Negative categories.
