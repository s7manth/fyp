Implementing a weighted voting system takes advantage of the distance or similarity measure used in KNN. By assigning more weight to the votes of closer neighbors, the classifier can resolve ties in a meaningful way that reflects the underlying assumption of KNNâ€”that test instances are more likely to belong to the category represented by their nearest neighbors. This solution directly addresses the issue of a split vote without fundamentally altering the nature of the KNN algorithm or its implementation, making it the best option among the given choices.
