The reasoning behind selecting option 1 as the correct answer is its broad applicability to various URL formats while still being precise enough not to capture unrelated text. This regular expression considers different parts of a URL, including:
- Protocols (http or https) through the `http[s]?` part.
- The broad range of characters allowed in URLs, matched by `(?:[a-zA-Z]|[0-9]|[$-_@.&+]|[!*\\(\\),]|(?:%[0-9a-fA-F][0-9a-fA-F]))+`, which includes domain letters, digits, special characters, and percent-encoding for reserved characters.

This makes it highly effective for the task of identifying and removing URLs from text in preprocessing steps of text analytics tasks, such as sentiment analysis, where the presence of URLs can be irrelevant and potentially misleading to the analysis.
