The reasoning behind choosing option 2 is its tailored approach to specifically match the patterns of email addresses and both types of URLs (http and https) with high accuracy. The pattern for email addresses (`\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\b`) ensures that it begins with a word boundary, followed by the permitted characters in email addresses, including a proper domain and a TLD of at least two characters. For URLs, it flexibly captures both "http" and "https" addresses by utilizing `https?` which makes the "s" optional, and then follows with any non-whitespace characters to ensure complete matching of the URL. This choice avoids potential pitfalls of overly broad matching that could inadvertently remove or alter non-target text, thus maintaining the integrity of the dataset while efficiently cleaning it.
