Dependency Parsing is chosen because it specifically focuses on the grammatical relationships between words in a sentence, which is essential for understanding how entities interact within legal documents. This approach allows the proposed system to capture the nuanced and complex functional relationships that are characteristic of legal language, such as who did what to whom, under what conditions, and with what consequences. By understanding these relationships, the system can more accurately summarize the key points and entity interactions in legal documents, which is the primary objective of the task at hand.
