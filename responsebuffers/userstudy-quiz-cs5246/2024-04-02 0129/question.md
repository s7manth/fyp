A natural language processing (NLP) engineer is tasked with designing a system to automatically summarize legal documents. The system must accurately identify the main entities involved (e.g., individuals, companies) and their relationships as defined within the text. Given the complexity of legal language and the critical importance of understanding the hierarchical and functional relationships between entities, which technique should the engineer prioritize implementing in the initial phase of system development?

1. Constituency Parsing to analyze sentence structure based on a hierarchy of constituents.
2. Dependency Parsing to model the grammatical relationships between words in a sentence.
3. Utilizing WordNet to understand the semantic relationships between key legal terms.
4. Implementing a basic Bag-of-Words model to capture the frequency of legal terms.
5. Designing custom Named Entity Recognition (NER) rules specific to legal terminology.
