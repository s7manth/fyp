Consider a dataset comprised of online customer reviews for a new tech gadget. As part of text preprocessing before conducting sentiment analysis, you decide to utilize regular expressions (regex) to clean and standardize the text data. One common pattern you observed in the dataset is the presence of various date formats that are irrelevant to the analysis and could potentially introduce noise. Which of the following regular expressions would be most effective in identifying and removing most of these date formats from the reviews?

1. `"\d{1,2}[\/-]\d{1,2}[\/-]\d{2,4}"`
2. `"\b\d{1,2}[-\/]\d{1,2}[-\/]\d{2,4}\b"`
3. `"[JFMASOND][aepuco][nbrylgptvc] \d{1,2}, \d{4}"`
4. `"(\d{1,2}[-\/]\d{1,2}[-\/]\d{2,4})|([JFMASOND][aepuco][nbrylgptvc] \d{1,2}, \d{4})"`
5. `"([0-9]+[-\/][0-9]+[-\/][0-9]+)|(([January|February|March|April|May|June|July|August|September|October|November|December] \d{1,2}, \d{4}))"`
