A researcher is analyzing customer feedback from an e-commerce website to determine sentiments towards various products using text mining. They want to focus on extracting noun phrases that express sentiment (e.g., "great battery life", "poor customer service") for more detailed sentiment analysis. Given that noun phrases can be structured in complex ways and sentiment can be nuanced, the researcher decides to employ both dependency parsing and WordNet to improve accuracy. Which of the following steps best describes an effective approach to achieve this?

1. Use dependency parsing to extract noun phrases and then apply WordNet to check for synonyms of "good" and "bad" within those phrases.
2. First, identify adjectives and adverbs using WordNet, then use constituency parsing to extract phrases around these modifiers.
3. Employ WordNet to find all sentiments associated with nouns and then use dependency parsing to link these nouns with descriptive adjectives in the feedback text.
4. Apply constituency parsing to identify sentence structure, then utilize WordNet to find hypernyms of key nouns and adjectives in the extracted phrases.
5. Conduct dependency parsing to identify relationships between nouns and adjectives/adverbs, and apply WordNet to discern the semantic orientation (positive or negative) of the adjectives/adverbs related to the product.
