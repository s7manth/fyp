The reasoning for the correct answer stems from a combination of syntactic and semantic analysis needs in the task. Dependency parsing is apt for identifying syntactic relationships within sentences, particularly useful for linking nouns with their descriptive adjectives or adverbs, which is critical for sentiment analysis. The dependency structure explicitly shows the connection between product features (nouns) and their evaluations (adjectives/adverbs).

On the semantic side, WordNet provides an understanding of the meanings and sentiment orientations of these descriptive words. Not all adjectives or adverbs are straightforward in their sentiment implication (e.g., "long" can be positive or negative depending on context: "long battery life" vs. "long wait times"), and WordNet helps in discerning these nuances by offering a database of word meanings, including their connotative angles.

This solution utilizes the strengths of both dependency parsing (for syntactical structure understanding) and WordNet (for semantic orientation and nuance understanding), making it the most effective approach among the options for extracting and analyzing sentiment-expressing noun phrases in customer feedback.
