To achieve accurate sentiment analysis by focusing on noun phrases that express sentiment, a combination of dependency parsing and WordNet can be employed effectively. 

- **Dependency Parsing:** This step is crucial for understanding the grammatical structure of the sentences by identifying relationships between "head" words and words which modify those heads. For sentiment analysis, particularly in extracting noun phrases that express sentiment, dependency parsing helps identify the relationships between nouns (e.g., products or features) and their descriptive adjectives (e.g., "great" or "poor").

- **WordNet:** After identifying these relationships, the next step is to understand the sentiment or semantic orientation of the descriptive words (adjectives and adverbs). WordNet, a lexical database for the English language, can help here by providing semantic relationships between words, including synonyms, antonyms, hypernyms, and hyponyms. For sentiment analysis, the crucial capability would be to discern the semantic orientation (positive or negative) of the adjectives or adverbs related to the product.

Given these explanations, the step that best describes an effective approach is:

- **Conduct dependency parsing to identify relationships between nouns and adjectives/adverbs, and apply WordNet to discern the semantic orientation (positive or negative) of the adjectives/adverbs related to the product.** 

This approach directly ties the syntactic structure provided by dependency parsing with the semantic insight provided by WordNet, focusing precisely on the task of extracting sentiment-expressing noun phrases and determining their sentiment orientation.
