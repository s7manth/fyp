In a natural language processing (NLP) project, a data scientist is analyzing customer reviews from an e-commerce website to extract insights about customer satisfaction with product delivery times. The dataset contains thousands of textual reviews, including expressions like "2-day delivery," "arrived in three days," "week-long shipping," and "overnight shipping." The data scientist plans to use regular expressions to identify and categorize these time-related expressions into predefined delivery timeframes: "1-day," "2-3 days," "4-7 days," and "more than a week."

Which of the following regular expressions could best be used to categorize the reviews into the "2-3 days" delivery timeframe category?

1. `\b([2-3]{1,2})-(day|days)\b`
2. `\b(2|two|3|three)\s*-(day|days)\b`
3. `\b(2|two|3|three)\s+(day|days)\b`
4. `\b(2|two|3|three)\s*(day|days)\b`
5. `([2-3]|two|three)\s+(day|days)\b`
