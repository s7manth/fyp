Jaccard Similarity is typically used in contexts where the similarity is measured based on the presence or absence of features (binary features), such as sets or binary vectors. However, TF-IDF produces numerical vectors where each dimension's value represents the term's weighted importance within the document and across the corpus, not just the occurrence. This characteristic makes Jaccard Similarity less appropriate because it disregards the magnitude of the values â€“ the essence of what TF-IDF vectors represent. Other options, despite their limitations, engage with the numerical nature and magnitude of the TF-IDF vectors, making them more suitable for document similarity tasks in the context mentioned.
