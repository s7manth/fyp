You are working on a machine learning model for a news recommendation system. For the content-based filtering part, you decide to use document similarity scores to recommend articles related to what a user has read. After converting the articles into vectors using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), you opt to calculate similarity between vectors to establish how closely related different articles are to each other.

Given your approach, which of the following similarity measures would NOT be appropriate for calculating document similarity using the TF-IDF vectors in your model?

1. Cosine Similarity
2. Jaccard Similarity
3. Euclidean Distance
4. Pearson Correlation
5. Manhattan Distance
