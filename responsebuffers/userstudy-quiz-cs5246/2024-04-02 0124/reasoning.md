The correct solution involves using a regex pattern that inversely matches (excludes) only the characters we want to keep in the text: word characters (`\w` includes `a-zA-Z0-9` and underscore `_`), whitespace characters (`\s`), and the specified punctuation marks. By doing so, it effectively targets and removes all characters outside this specified set, which includes a wide range of emojis and other non-standard symbols, without the need to individually address or identify each possible emoji or non-standard symbol directly. This approach, utilizing inverse matching with `[^...]`, is both elegant and efficient for the cleaning task described, making option 1 the most appropriate choice for preprocessing the dataset as stated in the scenario.
