The reasoning behind selecting option 3 as the correct answer lies in understanding the inherent characteristics and trade-offs of each model:

- **Naive Bayes** is fast and efficient, particularly suitable for tasks where the assumption of independence among features does not severely degrade performance. Its simplicity is advantageous for quickly developing models, especially in contexts where computational resources are limited or for baseline benchmarks.

- **Logistic Regression** works well with linearly separable data and is more flexible than Naive Bayes due to its ability to handle correlated features through regularization. However, like Naive Bayes, it might not capture complex patterns as effectively as models capable of modeling non-linear relationships.

- **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)** embodies the capability to learn non-linear relationships through its architecture, consisting of multiple layers of neurons with non-linear activation functions. This complexity allows MLPs to perform exceptionally well on tasks where the decision boundaries are not easily linearized. Nevertheless, this comes with increased computational costs and the necessity for larger datasets to train effectively without overfitting. In text classification, where intricate patterns might arise from the semantic relationships within the data, MLPs hold the potential for superior performance, assuming sufficient data and computational resources are available to harness their capabilities fully.
