A data science team is working on a clustering project to categorize news articles based on their topics. The dataset consists of thousands of news articles. To accomplish this, the team decides to represent the articles in a suitable format before applying clustering algorithms. Considering the characteristics of text data and the project's goal, which of the following text representation techniques is MOST appropriate for initially preprocessing the text data?

1. Term Frequency (TF)
2. Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)
3. Bag of Words (BoW)
4. Word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec)
5. Character n-grams
