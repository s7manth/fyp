Among the options provided, TF-IDF is the best fit for the task of clustering news articles based on their topics for several reasons:

- It reduces the weight of common words that are less informative about document distinctions, which is crucial for clustering, as common words can overshadow unique topic-specific terms.
- It amplifies the significance of unique words that may be critical in determining the topical differences between articles, hence facilitating a more effective grouping.
- Unlike simple frequency counts (TF and BoW), TF-IDF provides a more refined representation that balances term frequency with document uniqueness, a characteristic valuable for clustering tasks where discerning subtle differences between documents is essential.
- Although word embeddings offer rich semantic representations, their dense and continuous nature can make it challenging to apply traditional clustering algorithms without additional processing steps. Moreover, for document-level clustering, the nuanced semantic relationships captured by embeddings may not be as directly beneficial as the discriminative power provided by TF-IDF.
- Character n-grams, while useful in certain contexts, are not tailored towards capturing the thematic or topical essence of documents, which is the main goal in clustering news articles.
