The reasoning for choosing this option over the others lies in understanding both the nature of text data and the inherent characteristics of the models in question. Text data, especially in tasks like sentiment analysis, often results in high-dimensional, sparse feature matrices. Naive Bayes is known for being particularly effective in such scenarios due to its simplicity and the robust way it handles feature independence. This, combined with its computational efficiency compared to more complex models like MLP, makes it a suitable choice for sentiment analysis tasks, especially when rapid development and deployment are necessary, or when computational resources are limited. While MLP might capture more complex patterns in the data, its requirement for larger data sets, longer training times, and greater computational resources make it a more demanding choice, which does not inherently guarantee superior performance for all datasets and tasks.
