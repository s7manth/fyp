When it comes to sentiment analysis of movie reviews, a critical factor in choosing a model is not just the ability to achieve high accuracy but also considerations like model complexity, training time, and how well the model can handle the high-dimensional, sparse data typically encountered in text classification tasks. 

- **Naive Bayes** is known for its simplicity and efficiency, particularly in dealing with sparse datasets which is a common characteristic of text data. Its assumption of feature independence (while often unrealistic in natural language) allows for quick training times and surprisingly good performance for tasks like spam detection and sentiment analysis. Hence, it is particularly suited for sentiment analysis of movie reviews, especially when computational resources are limited or when a baseline model is needed quickly for benchmarking.

- **Logistic Regression** can be very effective for text classification tasks, including sentiment analysis. It handles large feature spaces reasonably well, especially with regularization techniques to control overfitting and can provide interpretable model weights. Therefore, the statement that Logistic Regression is less suitable due to its inability to handle large feature spaces efficiently is not accurate.

- **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)**, being a type of neural network, has the potential to capture complex nonlinear relationships in the data through its multiple layers and nonlinear activation functions. This capability can make it more powerful than Naive Bayes or Logistic Regression, especially when there's enough data to train on, and the model is properly regularized to prevent overfitting. However, it's not accurate to say that MLP always outperforms Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression in terms of accuracy for all text classification tasks, as its performance heavily depends on factors like the architecture chosen, the amount of data available, and how features are pre-processed and presented to the model.

Comparing these descriptions with the provided options, the most accurate statement regarding the application of these models to sentiment analysis of movie reviews is:

**3. Naive Bayes is particularly efficient for sentiment analysis of movie reviews because it inherently handles data sparsity well and is computationally less demanding than MLP.**
