In the context of a sentiment analysis task to classify movie reviews as either positive or negative, you decide to compare three different machine learning models based on their effectiveness and suitability for the task: Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). Considering the typical characteristics and common performance of these models on text data, which of the following statements is most accurate?

1. MLP always outperforms both Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression in terms of accuracy due to its ability to capture complex nonlinear relationships in the data.
2. Logistic Regression is less suitable for text classification tasks because it cannot handle large feature spaces as efficiently as Naive Bayes and MLP.
3. Naive Bayes is particularly efficient for sentiment analysis of movie reviews because it inherently handles data sparsity well and is computationally less demanding than MLP.
4. Naive Bayes tends to overfit the training data more than Logistic Regression and MLP when applied to text classification tasks.
5. MLP is inherently incapable of handling text data for sentiment analysis because it requires numerical input features.
