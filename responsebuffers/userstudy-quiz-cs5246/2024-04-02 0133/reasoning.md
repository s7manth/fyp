Among the text representation options provided:
- BoW and TF-IDF mainly focus on word frequency without capturing word order or context.
- One-hot Encoding represents words in isolation, not capturing any semantic relationships.
- Character N-grams are primarily useful for capturing spelling patterns and morphology rather than word-level semantics.

Only Word2Vec is specifically designed to understand the meaning and the context of words by placing semantically similar words closer together in the vector space. This makes it particularly useful for tasks that require a deep understanding of document content, such as clustering articles based on topics, where capturing the context and semantic relationships between words can significantly enhance the algorithm's ability to distinguish between different subjects.
