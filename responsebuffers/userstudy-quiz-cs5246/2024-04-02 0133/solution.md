To solve this question, it's essential to understand the different text representation methods mentioned and how they handle semantic information and context:

- **Bag of Words (BoW)**: Converts text into fixed-length vectors by counting word occurrences. However, it does not capture the order of words, making it quite limited in understanding context or semantic information.
  
- **Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)**: Builds on BoW by adjusting word counts based on their frequency across documents, aiming to highlight words that are unique to a particular document. While it's better at identifying important words, it still lacks the ability to capture semantic relationships between words.
  
- **Word2Vec**: This is a predictive model for learning word embeddings from raw text. It represents words in a continuous vector space, capturing semantic relationships based on the context in which words appear. Words that share similar contexts in the corpus are located in close proximity to one another in the vector space, thereby capturing both semantic information and context.
  
- **One-hot Encoding**: This method represents each word as a binary vector with all values as 0 except one, which is marked as 1 to represent the presence of that specific word. Like BoW, it doesn't capture order or semantic similarity between words.
  
- **Character N-grams**: This approach breaks down text into chunks of n consecutive characters. It's useful for capturing morphological information and spelling variations but falls short in capturing word-level semantic context as effectively as needed for understanding document similarity in this scenario.

Given the data scientist aims to capture semantic information and the context of words for clustering articles accurately, Word2Vec (Option 3) is the most suitable choice since it excels at understanding the similarity between documents based on their content by capturing semantic relationships between words.
