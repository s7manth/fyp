The correct answer is **2. Logistic Regression**.

To arrive at this decision, let's evaluate each option based on accuracy, interpretability, and suitability for text classification tasks:

- **Naive Bayes (NB):** NB is a probabilistic classifier that makes strong independence assumptions about the features. It is simple, efficient, and effective for large datasets. However, the independence assumption often does not hold in reality, especially in text data where words can have contextual dependencies. While NB is interpretable to some degree (as it associates probabilities with each feature's impact on the classification), it may not provide the level of detail desired for editorial review.

- **Logistic Regression (LR):** LR models the probabilities for classification problems and outputs values between 0 and 1. For text classification, it calculates weights for each feature (word or n-gram) indicating their importance in determining the category. This model provides a good balance between performance and interpretability. The coefficients can be directly associated with the importance of words in deciding the category, making it easier for editorial review and adjustment.

- **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP):** MLP is a type of neural network that consists of multiple layers of neurons with non-linear activation functions. While MLPs can capture complex relationships in the data and generally provide high accuracy, they lack in interpretability. The "black-box" nature of neural networks makes it challenging to understand the specific reasons behind a classification decision, which can be a significant drawback for tasks requiring editorial insight.

**Comparing the Options:**

- **Naive Bayes** offers efficiency and some level of interpretability but might not capture complex word dependencies well.
  
- **Logistic Regression** stands out for providing a solid trade-off between accuracy and interpretability, crucial for the task at hand. Editors can understand why an article was classified into a category by examining the feature coefficients.
  
- **Multi-Layer Perceptron** might offer superior performance but falls short on interpretability, making it less suitable for editorial review purposes.

Given the requirements – accurate classification and interpretable results for editorial review – **Logistic Regression** is the most suitable choice.
