Logistic Regression is chosen due to its capability to offer both high accuracy in text classification tasks and interpretable models. The coefficients in a Logistic Regression model offer clear insights into which words or features contribute most significantly to the classification decision, meeting the need for editorial teams to understand and review the categorization process. This blend of performance and transparency makes it particularly valuable for applications where understanding the 'why' behind a classification is as important as the classification itself.
