A data scientist is tasked with developing a text classification model to categorize news articles into distinct topics such as sports, politics, and technology. After evaluating several models, the individual has narrowed it down to three options based on their performance metrics: Naive Bayes (NB), Logistic Regression (LR), and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). Given the need for a model that not only accurately classifies articles but also provides interpretable results for editorial review, which of the following models should the data scientist select?

1. Naive Bayes
2. Logistic Regression
3. Multi-Layer Perceptron
4. Both Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression
5. Both Logistic Regression and Multi-Layer Perceptron
