## Question
In a recent project on natural language processing (NLP), an NLP engineer is tasked with classifying customer feedback into one of two categories: Positive or Negative. They decide to employ the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for this classification task. They plan to use the cosine similarity measure to identify the 'k' most similar training documents to a given test document. When processing a new piece of customer feedback (i.e., a test instance), the engineer observes a split vote among the 'k' nearest neighbors with an equal number of neighbors voting for both Positive and Negative categories.

Which adjustment to the KNN classification process could BEST resolve this split vote situation, ensuring a definitive classification for the test instance?

1. Adjust the value of 'k' to be either larger or smaller, ensuring it is an even number to avoid tie votes.
2. Implement a weighted voting system where closer neighbors have more influence on the classification decision than farther ones.
3. Increase the dimensionality of the feature space by including more descriptive words in the vocabulary.
4. Utilize a different similarity measure, such as Euclidean distance, instead of cosine similarity.
5. Apply dimensionality reduction techniques, such as PCA, to improve the separability of the Positive and Negative categories.

## Solution

To solve the split vote situation in a KNN classification task using cosine similarity, one needs to understand the behavior of KNN and the effect of similarity measures on classification. KNN classifies a test instance based on the majority vote of its 'k' nearest neighbors. When a tie occurs, it indicates that an equal number of neighbors belong to each category, leading to ambiguity in the decision.

The best way to deal with this issue is highlighted in option 2 - implementing a weighted voting system where closer neighbors have more influence on the classification decision than farther ones. This approach leverages the distances or similarity scores that are intrinsic to the KNN algorithm, assigning more weight to closer neighbors on the assumption that they are more likely to be in the same class as the test instance.

Option 1 suggests adjusting 'k' to be an even number, which is incorrect as having an even 'k' can actually lead to more ties. An odd value of 'k' is generally preferred to avoid ties, but this does not directly address the issue of a split vote.

Option 3 involves increasing dimensionality which might not necessarily help and could even worsen the situation by introducing the 'curse of dimensionality', where increasing the feature space without sufficient data can lead to sparsity and reduced model performance.

Option 4 proposes switching the similarity measure to Euclidean distance. While different similarity measures have their own merits, simply changing from cosine similarity to Euclidean distance without a specific rationale does not inherently solve the problem of tie votes.

Option 5 suggests applying dimensionality reduction techniques. While such techniques can sometimes improve separability and model performance by removing irrelevant features, they do not offer a direct solution to resolving a tie in the voting process of a KNN classifier.

## Correct Answer

2. Implement a weighted voting system where closer neighbors have more influence on the classification decision than farther ones.

## Reasoning

Implementing a weighted voting system takes advantage of the distance or similarity measure used in KNN. By assigning more weight to the votes of closer neighbors, the classifier can resolve ties in a meaningful way that reflects the underlying assumption of KNNâ€”that test instances are more likely to belong to the category represented by their nearest neighbors. This solution directly addresses the issue of a split vote without fundamentally altering the nature of the KNN algorithm or its implementation, making it the best option among the given choices.
