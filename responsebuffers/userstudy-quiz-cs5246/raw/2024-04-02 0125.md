## Question

You are tasked with developing a text preprocessing module for a sentiment analysis system that analyzes customer reviews of a new smartphone. One key step in your module is to remove URLs from the text, as they are not useful for sentiment analysis and could potentially skew the results.

Given a sample review:
"I just bought the new SuperPhone and it's amazing! Check out the specs here: http://www.superphone.com/specs. Best purchase I've made!"

Which of the following regular expressions would be most effective for identifying and removing the URL from this review text?

1. `http[s]?://(?:[a-zA-Z]|[0-9]|[$-_@.&+]|[!*\\(\\),]|(?:%[0-9a-fA-F][0-9a-fA-F]))+`
2. `http[s]?://[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,6}\\b/[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%_+.~#?&//=]*`
3. `www\\.[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,6}`
4. `http[s]?://[\\w-]+(\\.[\\w-]+)+[/#?]?.*$`
5. `^[http[s]?://|www\\.]([a-zA-Z0-9]+[.-]?)+[a-zA-Z0-9]{2,6}([/\\w-./?%&=]*)?$`

## Solution

To identify and remove the URL from the review text effectively, one needs to understand the structure of URLs and how they can be represented using regular expressions. A URL typically follows a standard format that can include the protocol (http or https), domain name (with subdomains), a port number (optional), and path to specific resources (optional).

- Option 1: `http[s]?://(?:[a-zA-Z]|[0-9]|[$-_@.&+]|[!*\\(\\),]|(?:%[0-9a-fA-F][0-9a-fA-F]))+` is a comprehensive regular expression that matches the http or https protocols, followed by any combination of allowed characters in URLs. This pattern is quite effective in matching URLs in a broad range of formats and would work for removing the URL in the given review text.

- Option 2: `http[s]?://[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,6}\\b/[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%_+.~#?&//=]*` also matches URLs that start with http or https, followed by domain names (including subdomains). However, it specifically looks for a period before the top-level domain (TLD), which is correct, and it allows for paths and query parameters. This expression is also effective but more detailed in the path and query parameter matching compared to option 1.

- Option 3: `www\\.[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,6}` only matches URLs that start with "www." and does not account for the http or https protocols. This makes it less suitable for the given task since URLs in customer reviews can appear with or without the "www." prefix.

- Option 4: `http[s]?://[\\w-]+(\\.[\\w-]+)+[/#?]?.*$` matches URLs starting with http or https, followed by domain names. This expression ends with an optional path or query parameter section. While it covers a broad range of URLs, the use of `\w` (which includes letters, digits, and underscores) and the lack of specificity in allowed characters may miss some URLs with special characters.

- Option 5: `^[http[s]?://|www\\.]([a-zA-Z0-9]+[.-]?)+[a-zA-Z0-9]{2,6}([/\\w-./?%&=]*)?$` attempts to match URLs from the start of the string and includes conditions for both protocols and "www." prefix. However, this expression is overly restrictive for the given task as it assumes the URL starts at the beginning of the text, which is not the case for the middle of sentences as seen in most reviews.

After evaluating all options, the most effective and broad matching regular expression for identifying and removing URLs from text, without being overly restrictive or missing URLs with special characters, is:

**Option 1: `http[s]?://(?:[a-zA-Z]|[0-9]|[$-_@.&+]|[!*\\(\\),]|(?:%[0-9a-fA-F][0-9a-fA-F]))+`**

This regex effectively captures the protocol, domain, and any subsequent parts of the URL, making it suitable for the task of cleaning review texts from URLs in a sentiment analysis system.

## Correct Answer

1. `http[s]?://(?:[a-zA-Z]|[0-9]|[$-_@.&+]|[!*\\(\\),]|(?:%[0-9a-fA-F][0-9a-fA-F]))+`

## Reasoning

The reasoning behind selecting option 1 as the correct answer is its broad applicability to various URL formats while still being precise enough not to capture unrelated text. This regular expression considers different parts of a URL, including:
- Protocols (http or https) through the `http[s]?` part.
- The broad range of characters allowed in URLs, matched by `(?:[a-zA-Z]|[0-9]|[$-_@.&+]|[!*\\(\\),]|(?:%[0-9a-fA-F][0-9a-fA-F]))+`, which includes domain letters, digits, special characters, and percent-encoding for reserved characters.

This makes it highly effective for the task of identifying and removing URLs from text in preprocessing steps of text analytics tasks, such as sentiment analysis, where the presence of URLs can be irrelevant and potentially misleading to the analysis.
