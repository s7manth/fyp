## Question
You are working on a sentiment analysis project where your task involves preprocessing a large dataset of customer reviews for a machine learning model. The reviews are stored as strings in a dataset, with some reviews containing URLs, email addresses, and various forms of punctuation that you intend to clean up. You decide to use regular expressions (regex) to streamline the preprocessing phase. Given the scenario, which of the following regex patterns accurately identifies and allows for the removal of URLs and email addresses without significantly impacting other text content?

1. `r'\S*@\S*\s|\bhttp:\/\/\S+'`
2. `r'\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\b|\bhttps?://\S+'`
3. `r'@\S+|\bhttp\S+'`
4. `r'\S*@\S*\s|\bhttps?://\S+\b'`
5. `r'\b[A-Za-z]+@\S+|\bhttp\S+'`

## Solution

To determine the correct regex pattern for removing URLs and email addresses, let's examine each option closely:

1. `r'\S*@\S*\s|\bhttp:\/\/\S+'`: This pattern looks for any non-whitespace sequence that contains an "@" sign followed by any non-whitespace sequence (which could match email addresses but might also match other content accidentally), and URLs starting specifically with "http://". It misses "https://" URLs and could remove valid text following "@" if not correctly formatted as an email.

2. `r'\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\b|\bhttps?://\S+'`: This pattern carefully matches email addresses by specifying characters allowed in the local-part and domain part of the email, followed by a TLD (Top Level Domain) with at least two characters. It also matches both "http" and "https" URLs followed by any non-whitespace characters, which accurately targets URLs. This is a more precise method avoiding the removal of unintended text.

3. `r'@\S+|\bhttp\S+'`: Similar to the first, this pattern finds sequences with "@" followed by non-whitespace characters and URLs that start with "http". It lacks specificity for email addresses and misses "https://" URLs.

4. `r'\S*@\S*\s|\bhttps?://\S+\b'`: This pattern attempts to identify any sequence with an "@" sign and URLs with either "http" or "https". While it covers both types of URLs, the email matching is too generic and might lead to false positives by capturing more than just email addresses.

5. `r'\b[A-Za-z]+@\S+|\bhttp\S+'`: This option specifies the start of an email address with alphabetical characters and captures the entirety of the email address, but is unspecific, potentially capturing more than desired. It also only specifically captures URLs starting with "http" and not "https".

The most accurate regex pattern for the task described is:

**Option 2: `r'\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\b|\bhttps?://\S+'`**

This option precisely identifies both email addresses and URLs (either http or https) without overlap with unintended text content.

## Correct Answer

2. `r'\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\b|\bhttps?://\S+'`

## Reasoning

The reasoning behind choosing option 2 is its tailored approach to specifically match the patterns of email addresses and both types of URLs (http and https) with high accuracy. The pattern for email addresses (`\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\b`) ensures that it begins with a word boundary, followed by the permitted characters in email addresses, including a proper domain and a TLD of at least two characters. For URLs, it flexibly captures both "http" and "https" addresses by utilizing `https?` which makes the "s" optional, and then follows with any non-whitespace characters to ensure complete matching of the URL. This choice avoids potential pitfalls of overly broad matching that could inadvertently remove or alter non-target text, thus maintaining the integrity of the dataset while efficiently cleaning it.
