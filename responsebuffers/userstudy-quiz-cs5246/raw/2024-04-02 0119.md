## Question

A researcher is analyzing customer feedback from an e-commerce website to determine sentiments towards various products using text mining. They want to focus on extracting noun phrases that express sentiment (e.g., "great battery life", "poor customer service") for more detailed sentiment analysis. Given that noun phrases can be structured in complex ways and sentiment can be nuanced, the researcher decides to employ both dependency parsing and WordNet to improve accuracy. Which of the following steps best describes an effective approach to achieve this?

1. Use dependency parsing to extract noun phrases and then apply WordNet to check for synonyms of "good" and "bad" within those phrases.
2. First, identify adjectives and adverbs using WordNet, then use constituency parsing to extract phrases around these modifiers.
3. Employ WordNet to find all sentiments associated with nouns and then use dependency parsing to link these nouns with descriptive adjectives in the feedback text.
4. Apply constituency parsing to identify sentence structure, then utilize WordNet to find hypernyms of key nouns and adjectives in the extracted phrases.
5. Conduct dependency parsing to identify relationships between nouns and adjectives/adverbs, and apply WordNet to discern the semantic orientation (positive or negative) of the adjectives/adverbs related to the product.

## Solution

To achieve accurate sentiment analysis by focusing on noun phrases that express sentiment, a combination of dependency parsing and WordNet can be employed effectively. 

- **Dependency Parsing:** This step is crucial for understanding the grammatical structure of the sentences by identifying relationships between "head" words and words which modify those heads. For sentiment analysis, particularly in extracting noun phrases that express sentiment, dependency parsing helps identify the relationships between nouns (e.g., products or features) and their descriptive adjectives (e.g., "great" or "poor").

- **WordNet:** After identifying these relationships, the next step is to understand the sentiment or semantic orientation of the descriptive words (adjectives and adverbs). WordNet, a lexical database for the English language, can help here by providing semantic relationships between words, including synonyms, antonyms, hypernyms, and hyponyms. For sentiment analysis, the crucial capability would be to discern the semantic orientation (positive or negative) of the adjectives or adverbs related to the product.

Given these explanations, the step that best describes an effective approach is:

- **Conduct dependency parsing to identify relationships between nouns and adjectives/adverbs, and apply WordNet to discern the semantic orientation (positive or negative) of the adjectives/adverbs related to the product.** 

This approach directly ties the syntactic structure provided by dependency parsing with the semantic insight provided by WordNet, focusing precisely on the task of extracting sentiment-expressing noun phrases and determining their sentiment orientation.

## Correct Answer

5. Conduct dependency parsing to identify relationships between nouns and adjectives/adverbs, and apply WordNet to discern the semantic orientation (positive or negative) of the adjectives/adverbs related to the product.

## Reasoning

The reasoning for the correct answer stems from a combination of syntactic and semantic analysis needs in the task. Dependency parsing is apt for identifying syntactic relationships within sentences, particularly useful for linking nouns with their descriptive adjectives or adverbs, which is critical for sentiment analysis. The dependency structure explicitly shows the connection between product features (nouns) and their evaluations (adjectives/adverbs).

On the semantic side, WordNet provides an understanding of the meanings and sentiment orientations of these descriptive words. Not all adjectives or adverbs are straightforward in their sentiment implication (e.g., "long" can be positive or negative depending on context: "long battery life" vs. "long wait times"), and WordNet helps in discerning these nuances by offering a database of word meanings, including their connotative angles.

This solution utilizes the strengths of both dependency parsing (for syntactical structure understanding) and WordNet (for semantic orientation and nuance understanding), making it the most effective approach among the options for extracting and analyzing sentiment-expressing noun phrases in customer feedback.
