## Question
A natural language processing (NLP) engineer is tasked with designing a system to automatically summarize legal documents. The system must accurately identify the main entities involved (e.g., individuals, companies) and their relationships as defined within the text. Given the complexity of legal language and the critical importance of understanding the hierarchical and functional relationships between entities, which technique should the engineer prioritize implementing in the initial phase of system development?

1. Constituency Parsing to analyze sentence structure based on a hierarchy of constituents.
2. Dependency Parsing to model the grammatical relationships between words in a sentence.
3. Utilizing WordNet to understand the semantic relationships between key legal terms.
4. Implementing a basic Bag-of-Words model to capture the frequency of legal terms.
5. Designing custom Named Entity Recognition (NER) rules specific to legal terminology.

## Solution
To design a system capable of summarizing legal documents with high accuracy, it's essential to not only identify the entities involved but also understand the complex grammatical relationships and dependencies that govern their interactions. Legal documents frequently use intricate sentence structures that define specific roles and relationships between entities (e.g., plaintiff, defendant, beneficiary), which can significantly impact their meaning and interpretation.

1. **Constituency Parsing** provides a way to analyze the sentence structure by breaking down sentences into a hierarchical tree of constituents. While useful for understanding how sentences are structured and for certain types of linguistic and syntactical analysis, this approach might not directly provide clear insights into the specific relationships between entities, which are critical in legal documents.

2. **Dependency Parsing** directly addresses the need to model grammatical relationships between individual words in a sentence, making it particularly suited for understanding the functional relationships and dependencies between entities. This information is crucial for summarizing legal documents as it can help in accurately identifying how entities are related or what actions are taken by or against them.

3. **Utilizing WordNet** to understand semantic relationships between key legal terms can enrich the system's ability to interpret synonyms and hierarchical relationships between concepts. However, WordNet alone does not offer insights into the grammatical or functional relationships between entities in the context of their specific use within legal sentences.

4. **Implementing a basic Bag-of-Words model** captures the frequency of terms but lacks the ability to understand sentence structure, context, or the relationships between terms, making it insufficient for the nuanced task of summarizing legal documents.

5. **Designing custom Named Entity Recognition (NER) rules** could be highly effective in identifying specific legal entities but would not, on its own, provide insights into the complex relationships between these entities as defined by the legal language.

Given these considerations, the best technique to prioritize for accurately identifying and understanding the relationships between entities in legal documents is **Dependency Parsing**.

## Correct Answer
2. Dependency Parsing to model the grammatical relationships between words in a sentence.

## Reasoning
Dependency Parsing is chosen because it specifically focuses on the grammatical relationships between words in a sentence, which is essential for understanding how entities interact within legal documents. This approach allows the proposed system to capture the nuanced and complex functional relationships that are characteristic of legal language, such as who did what to whom, under what conditions, and with what consequences. By understanding these relationships, the system can more accurately summarize the key points and entity interactions in legal documents, which is the primary objective of the task at hand.
