A data scientist is working on a sentiment analysis task to classify movie reviews into positive or negative sentiments using a text mining approach. They have preprocessed the text data and now must select an appropriate model for classification. Considering the nature of text data and the sentiment analysis task at hand, which of the following models would be most appropriate for initially experimenting due to its underlying assumptions about feature independence and its efficacy in text classification tasks?

1. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) specialized for image processing tasks
2. A Multivariate Linear Regression model treating each word's presence as a predictor
3. A Naive Bayes classifier given its assumption of feature independence and success in text classifications
4. A Reinforcement Learning model designed for sequential decision-making tasks
5. A Random Forest model focusing on decision trees that require extensive parameter tuning for text data
