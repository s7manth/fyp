To solve this question, one must understand the basic theoretical concepts behind each model mentioned and how they relate to text classification tasks, specifically sentiment analysis.

- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**: While CNNs have been adapted for NLP tasks, they are primarily designed for image processing tasks due to their ability to capture spatial hierarchies in images. Their application to text, though possible, is not the most straightforward choice for a first experiment in sentiment analysis.
  
- **Multivariate Linear Regression**: This model assumes a linear relationship between predictor variables and the outcome variable. However, sentiment analysis often involves complex relationships between words (predictors) and sentiments (outcomes) that are not linear, making it unsuitable for this task.
  
- **Naive Bayes Classifier**: This model is well-suited for text classification due to its assumption of feature (word) independence and its simplicity. Despite this simplifying assumption often being violated in natural language (words in sentences are not truly independent), Naive Bayes performs remarkably well in practice for sentiment analysis and other text classification tasks. It's also computationally efficient with large text datasets.
  
- **Reinforcement Learning Model**: These models are designed for environments where an agent makes sequential decisions to maximize some notion of cumulative reward. While innovative, applying reinforcement learning to a straightforward sentiment analysis task without clear sequential decision-making or action-reward scenarios would be overly complex and not appropriate as an initial experiment.
  
- **Random Forest**: Although Random Forest is a powerful ensemble learning method and can be applied to classification tasks, it requires extensive tuning, especially for text data which often has high dimensionality (many unique words). Additionally, its performance may not surpass simpler models, like Naive Bayes, for text classification due to its complex structure and the specific challenges of handling sparse, high-dimensional text data.

Given these considerations, the **Naive Bayes classifier** is the most appropriate choice for initiating experiments in sentiment analysis of text data, due to its simplicity, efficiency, and surprisingly strong performance in text classification tasks despite its assumption of feature independence.
